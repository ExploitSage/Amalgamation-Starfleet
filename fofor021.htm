<h3>ASK DR. FORTRAN</h3>
<h4>by Dr. Pascal Fortran</h4>
<p><strong>EXPERIMENT 1510am - AIR</strong></p>
<p>To prove the validity and/or existence of air, I volunteered the help of the my
   daughter (female, adolescent, age 13).  We stepped out onto the porch to conduct
   our test.  Neither one of us could see air.  This was perceived as a negative
   indication.  My daughter could detect the delicate aroma of the nearby water
   treatment plant, while I was able to ascertained the subtle odor of carbon monoxide
   from I-10.  The scent of air was not detected by either of us.  The absence of the
   sound of air was also noted.  We proceeded with our next test.  Sticking our tongues
   out at each other, air appeared to elude the taste test.  Finally, each of us tried
   to grab some air to take back into the house for further study.  We came up empty
   handed.
</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS</strong></p>
<p>After the concept of air failed the five senses test, we can neither confirm nor
   deny the existence of the test subject.  Please do not let our own negative
   experiences dissuade you from your own experiments.
</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIMENT 92.3fm - ACCELERATION/DECELERATION</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, with the unwanted assistance of my son (adult, Pataphysical
   Philosophy student, 2nd year Freshman) the effects of rapid acceleration and
   deceleration were tested on a 1988 Dodge Aries.  The test vehicle was piloted down
   a straight road in excess of the legal posted speed limit but beneath the speed of
   sound (unposted).  Acceleration was assumed to be the result of a V6 internal
   combustion engine and a lead foot, but this can not be confirmed.  Flight was
   achieved by rapid acceleration and a bump in the roadway.  Rapid deceleration was
   brought on by gravity and with the help of a concrete culvert.
</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS</strong></p>
<p>Due to the horrible effects of rapid deceleration on the monitors in the vehicle
   no test results can be provided at this time, but it is believed that rapid
   deceleration causes safety glass to shatter, metals to crumple and tires to blow
   out.  The assistant walked away only slightly scratched.  The vehicle was moved to
   Knesel Salvage Yard where it was the object of ridicule and insults.  The theory
   that cars can fly has been suggested by many innovative authorities over the years.
   The notion the a giant hand came out of the sky and caused the vehicle to become
   airborne can not be discarded, regardless of the trooper&#39;s unwillingness to
   note said hypothesis on the accident report.  A replacement test article has been
   purchased.  Further studies will be conducted over my dead body.
</p>
<p><strong>EXPERIMENT 92.3FM - ACCELERATION/DECELERATION - ADDENDUM</strong></p>
<p>As the pilot of the aforementioned test vehicle I feel I would be remiss if I did
   not correct my male parental unit.  Although the result of the experiment remains
   the same, the path taken is slightly changed from the aforementioned one.  I followed
   more of a rectilinear/curving path (it bounced from side to side on the road).
   Flight was still attained, but I believe that the difference in the flight path
   could make a crucial difference.
</p>
<p>The following solution has been supplied, hoping that it meets the needs of some
   problem or experiment.
</p>
<p><strong>Solution 468.4</strong></p>
<p>Completely immerse a pair of nylon control-top pantyhose (unoccupied) into a can
   of chocolate syrup.  Load the feet with charcoal briquettes and partially air dry
   using centrifugal force, while holding them with a pair of vice grips clamped to
   the waistband.  If you did this procedure indoors, that is mistake #1.  Crush the
   briquettes using the tapered end of a standard 2X4.  Soak the pantyhose in a heated
   mixture of stannous fluoride and 10W40 until the remaining particles become
   suspended.  Carefully cut the legs off using the edge of a dull spoon.  Discard the
   top portion.  It is useless, unless you plan to rob a convenience store.  If tried
   to use one of the cut pieces as a condom, this will be mistake #2.  You now have
   enough material to safely transport your two pet rocks to the petting zoo.
