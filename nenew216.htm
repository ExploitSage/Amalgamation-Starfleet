<h2>STOCKER SEEKS HIS ELEVENTH TERM!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Lake Pomona, NAFeD, Earth (NIPS)</div>
<p>Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms Pro-Consul Jack Stocker announced today
   that he will seek an unprecedented eleventh term as head administrator of the
   Amalgamation&#39;s government.
</p>
<p>In an excited but wonderfully dressed, press conference, held on the shiny steps
   of the commanding Rhondstat Building, Stocker told the calmly waiting, but
   approvingly nervous, gathering, &#34;<q>I am, once again, a candidate for the position I
   have graciously held for these last 60 years, that of Pro-Consul of your
   Amalgamation!  When re-elected, I promise a vigorous campaign to bring renewed
   development along the Hinterlands, and to the Rubble Zone, a lasting peace and
   cooperation with the Klingfrees, and, I promise to bring to the peace table, either
   by force or coercion, those chancre-covered monosexuals from the cesspools of the
   damned, the Remoulades.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Great cheering followed the dignified speech, the dignity which has marked the
   many fruitful, though sometimes horrendously dangerous, years that Stocker has held
   the technically highest post in government.  Stocker then entertained questions
   from the press, the first from NIPS reporter Wilget d&#39;Skoupe, who quietly asked,
   &#34;<q>what will be your campaign slogan?</q>&#34;  To which Stocker responded, &#34;<q>I&#39;m
   sorry, I didn&#39;t hear your question?</q>&#34;  When the question was repeated by
   someone with a less meek voice, Stoker told the patient yet daintily antsy crowd,
   &#34;<q>I have talked to the people, and their slogan is mine.  &#39;<q>Why Change Now?</q>&#39;,
   the people ask, and I concur.  Why Change Now?!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>The conference broke up after a few more innocuous but politically necessary
   questions, and reporters then hurried to the Amalgamation Office of Elections and
   Motor Vehicle Registration, where they found more candidates lined up to qualify.
   Those who were able to meet the thirty minute deadline, post the $1,000,000 fee,
   present 5,000 signatures from every system, and deposit on record the amount of
   alcoholic beverages consumed by them in the last month, were:
</p>
<p>Phre4d Drucker, known to the people of the Shady Rest System as Honest Tom,
   representing the Whole Intergalactic Masculine Party (W.I.M.P.);
</p>
<p>Oliver Kloezov, representing the Amalgamation&#39;s second largest political party,
   the Disestablishmentarians;
</p>
<p>Algonquin J. Calhoun, leader of the Aymusenandee System, and candidate for the
   Mystic Knights of the Sea party;
</p>
<p>Murgatroid McGullicuddy of Whazzunda Dekilt, the Loyal Order of Raccoon&#39;s
   candidate;
</p>
<p>And Susan B. Anthony LIII, a radical economist from Czechda Buks, representing the
   interests of her party, the Patrons of Husbandry.
</p>
<p>With the election being tomorrow, we can expect the paper to be filled with
   campaign ads, raking in lots of extra dough for this newspaper.
</p>
<h2>CARSAILSMIAN MEETING TO BEGIN!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Idi Amin Diplomatic Liaison Center, NAFed, Earth - (NNN)</div>
<p>News from the Southern Void, on a not yet named planet, has been brought, saying
   that Amalgamation diplomat Yueg Gazzongas has been able to set up meetings with the
   newly found empire of the Carsailsmians.
</p>
<p>Hopes here are high for success, for, even though the Carsailsmians have shown
   themselves to be ruthless in their negotiations, Ambassador Gazzongas has a
   reputation for being utterly more ruthless.
</p>
<p>Many people will remember that it was Ambassador Gazzongas who was able to
   convince the victors in the Franco-Mustard War that, even thought they had been
   attacked by their slimy, back-stabbing, wart-ridden enemies,  they were the actual
   aggressors, and that, even though they had won, they should give territory to the
   Mustards and pay reparations for the next 30 millennia.
</p>
<p>In order to enforce an agreement, Amalgamation Admiral of the Fleet, Hiawatha M.
   Niagara has ordered Admiral Reverend Dr. Sir Frisken Search to take his 16th Fleet
   and rendezvous with Admiral Rip D. Faughtze and her First Fleet, the Divine Wind,
   and with Admiral Zbigneu Rheal with his Nullifying Ninth Fleet.  Starfleet Chief
   of Staff Admiral Red C. Pedestrian says orders have been given that, in the event
   that negotiations should break down or fail, Admiral Search may begin live testing
   of the firepower of his new Paladin class Corpulent GunCruisers.

<h2>Saint Mitch Presented!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Milkbone, Canis Majoris Pinkus Sector  (NIPS)</div>
<p>In the setting of a gala banquet and costume ball, the Amalgamation of Non-Aligned
   Lifeforms Starfleet inducted two new members into it&#39;s most prestigious group,
   The Order of Saint Mitch.
</p>
<p>This year&#39;s inductees were Staff Fleet Admiral Sleapz F&#39;Faggs, leader of
   Starfleet&#39;s crack 69th Patrol Unit, and designer of the Porneaux class Patrol
   ships, and P.C.S.L.C. Admiral Wil E. Dicker, leader of the Glorious Second Fleet,
   and son of the late Admiral of the Fleet, H. L. Niagara.
</p>
<p>F&#39;Faggs was selected for the honor due to his brave and ingenious actions
   during the Trial of the Millennia, particularly his discovery of the false pretender
   to the admiralty.  Dicker was granted the honor for his bravery and his
   gentlemanliness, particularly when he graciously gave up his claim to the post of
   Admiral of the Fleet.
</p>
<p>When cornered by reporters during the gala, Admiral Wilhelm Klink said, &#34;<q>Hey,
   is this thing on?  OK, well, both guys are great, productive members of Starfleet,
   having both shown valor above and beyond the call of vacuity.  Not a nickel, er,
   woman, er, I mean enemy, escapes their grasps.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Noticed begging for attention, reporters asked  Admiral Guhd E. Gumdrop for a
   quote.  He responded, &#34;<q>To Be, or not to be.  That is the question.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Barging into the mike, Admiral Lady Slong Deray said, &#34;<q>Well, they couldn&#39;t
   have found two better people for the award.  Well, they could have, but me and Rip
   are already in the club!</q>&#34;

<h2>RICEROENEE COOKED!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Hamburg, Erhelper, Qwikdin Sector (NPI)</div>
<p>The small, slightly uninhabited astrosphere of Riceroenee was burned to a crisp
   when the Amalgamation Trotsky class Mediocre cruiser A.S.S. THOMAS E. DEWEY, under
   the command of Admiral Cher Tha Welth, accidentally mistook the mini-planet for an
   incoming torpedo.
</p>
<p>Starfleet Command reported that the DEWEY, on routine patrol in the Qwikdin Sector,
   suddenly detected an unknown object heading directly for the ship.  Following
   Starfleet General Order #2, which states, &#34;<q>shoot first, interrogate and
   investigate after,</q>&#34; Admiral Welth opened fire on the unidentified object.
</p>
<p>Contacted on her ship, Admiral Welth told reporters, &#34;<q>Can you say
   &#39;<q>Saut&eacute; and simmer</q>&#39;?  Well, that&#39;s just about what happened.  We
   rolled a one before launching Pharton torpedoes, and, well, before you could say,
   &#39;<q>Umm, Umm, Good</q>&#39;, the planetoid was toast.</q>&#34;
