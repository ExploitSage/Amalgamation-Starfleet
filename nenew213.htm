<h2>RHONDSTAT SENDS AID TO DEPRIVED SYSTEM!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Lake Pomona, NaFed, Earth, You Know Where<br />(Original idea
   pirated from &#39;The Onion&#39;, with embellishments added)
</div>
<p>In one of the greatest relief efforts in our time, the Rhondstat, the law-making
   council of the Amalgamation Of Non-Aligned Lifeforms, gave orders to Admiral of the
   Fleet Hiawatha M. Niagara to send 1.5 million non-consonants to the vowel-ravaged
   planet of HSSLHFF.
</p>
<p>Speaking for the government, Amalgamation Pro-Consul Stocker stressed the
   importance of this action.  &#34;<q>For too long have we been forced to guess how to say
   Ngl, Mchl, Spczz, Prtt, Bdr(x), Chll, Cvtt, Grllt, Frst Bt Flls and other
   geographical locations in their system</q>&#34;, stressed Stocker. &#34;<q>A&#39;s, E&#39;s,
   I&#39;s, O&#39;s and U&#39;s are the basis for a civilized and well-mannered
   society.  Unfortunately, Y&#39;s are not part of the aid program at this time.
   Sorry, Anthon!  Try using <em>i</em> or <em>ie</em>.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Some members of the Rhondstat, and in particular Alf A. Newmerik (R- Lexi Grafer),
   uttered concerns that the letters might be used in verbal warfare against the
   Amalgamation.  They received assurances from Niagara that the characters involved
   could only be used in nouns, pronouns and proper nouns.  In addition, Admiral
   Niagara confirmed that no acutes, graves or umlauts would be shipped, and emphasized
   that these vowels would not be used in the production of any diphthongs.
</p>
<p>The President of Hsslhff, Wrrn F. Qntssntl and Mayor Thdr Fnrd of Brghtn Bch
   praised the Rhondstat for their compassion.  &#34;<q>Fnnly wll b abl t prnnce Brlngtn,
   Phnx, nd Dtrt th w th wr rgnll ntndd,</q>&#34; Qntssntl intoned.  His Eminence declared,
   &#34;<q>Hey, I love vowels!  If it wasn&#39;t for them, I&#39;d be Hwth M. Ngr!</q>&#34;</p>
<p>The first shipments of 151,000 emergency E&#39;s are already in route to Fnfrsn.
   Special care has been take with the labeling of the packages containing the letters
   to insure that they will not be mistaken for the dreaded schwa. Also, the people of
   Hsslssf were assured that no &#34;<q>silent</q>&#34; E&#39;s are being sent.  Mirriam Webster,
   chief of quality control at Niagarabet, supplier of the letters, said, &#34;<q>We have
   double-checked the shipment and can promise that all E&#39;s left our factory in
   100% working order!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>If all goes well, with this endeavor, another 1 million vowels will be sent later
   this year so that the people of Hsslhff can spell their names correctly.
</p>
<p>In return, Hsslhff promises to export all of their excess zeroes so that they
   may be used in the printing of the Niagara Industries, Ltd., Annual Report.
</p>
<h2>DAKKAR SLAMS PEDESTRAIN!
    <span class="subhead">Bride Proclaims, &#34;<q>Been There, Done That.</q>&#34;</span>
</h2>
<div class="dateline">Henson Memorial Command Center, Lake Pomona, NAFed, Earth
   &mdash; (NIPS)</div>
<p>Allegations are being flung around Starfleet Headquarters like cows from catapults.
   Reports from the Barcardi System seem to indicate that the missing Admiral Dakkar
   Keapz Stalin has supposedly accused Admiral Red C. Pedestrian of being &#34;<q>cranially
   impotent</q>&#34;, being hung like a snail and having to get married because he was
   pregnant.
</p>
<p>When told of the suspected slander Red characteristically replied, &#34;<q>Bite me.
   I have nothing against Stalin.  I like Stalin.  I think he makes a thrilling
   addition to the reptile family.  He can write whatever he wants about me.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>When the difference between libel and slander was explained to him Red replied,
   &#34;<q>Bite me.</q>&#34;  Then Lady Pedestrian, the former Boffme Sweethart, walked into the
   room with their love child Czar Nicholas, and Red began to teach him the finer
   points of used car salesmanship.
</p>
<h2>DOGS CATCH SCENT OF STALIN!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Deep, Really Deep In Space, In A Place Even Admiral Gumdrop
   Never Heard Of Before (NNN)</div>
<p>Admiral Nuntha &#39;<q>Bud</q>&#39; Weiser, head of the Amalgamation Starfleet&#39;s Crack
   82nd Space Dog Procurement Unit, who has been on the trail of the elusive Stalin for
   the last 720 minutes said. &#34;<q>I hope to have my hands, or at least one of my
   flunkies, er, junior officers&#39; hands, on Admiral Stalin and the missing deduct
   box within minutes!  We know he&#39;s in the vicinity of Wheremachek.  We&#39;ve
   found several hamsters wrapped in duct tape out behind the adult theater on that
   planet.  He has to do that to keep the rodents from exploding while he performs,
   well, since you run a family paper, I won&#39;t mention any deviant sexual practices.
   Unlike the rest of us, he does not enjoy good mental health.  But that&#39;s what
   makes him a good Fleet Officer!</q>&#34;
</p>
<h2>THE REAL WORLD
    <span class="subhead">OBITUARY</span>
</h2>
<p>Keith &#39;<q>Jake</q>&#39; Jacobs, a.k.a. Major Captain Dir T. Ohlman, a long-standing
   member of the Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms Starfleet, has passed from among
   us. We would like to reprint excerpts from a note sent by his good friend, Robert
   Neagle, to the Porno Patrol:
</p>
<p>IT IS WITH THE DEEPEST REGRET THAT I WRITE THIS LETTER TO LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT
   WE HAVE LOST A DEAR FRIEND.
</p>
<p>KEITH &#39;<q>JAKE</q>&#39; JACOBS WAS KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT (APRIL 9, 1996),
   WHILE ON HIS WAY HOME FROM NEW ORLEANS TO PEARLINGTON, MISSISSIPPI.
</p>
<p>HE IS SORELY MISSED ALREADY BY THE PATROL AND ALL OF HIS FANNISH FAMILY.
</p>
<p>HE WAS CRESCENT CITY CON XI &#39;S FAN  GUEST OF HONOR  AND THIS YEAR&#39;S CON
   WILL BE DEDICATED TO HIS MEMORY.
</p>
<p>GOODBYE, JAKE.   WE ALL  LOVE YOU AND MISS YOU.  YOU MAY BE GONE BUT YOU WILL
   NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. YOU LIVE IN OUR HEARTS WITH US EACH DAY.
</p>
<p>YOU ALWAYS WERE AND WILL BE OUR FRIEND.
</p>
<h2>HEAUX GETS HEAD JOB!</h2>
<div class="dateline">1 Niagara Township, NAFed., Earth  (NIPS)</div>
<p>In a bold thrust into a new not-so-new arena, the Planets of Pleasure Corporation
   (POPCO) announced today that it would start a new division to be called Oral
   Fantasies.  POPCO President and CEO Staff Fleet Admiral Reverend Dr. Sir Frisken
   Search declared that, after an exhaustive probe into the qualifications of several
   applicants he picked Star Fleet chanteuse, Heidi Heaux to head the division.
</p>
<p>Heaux, a former Poptart, literally slurped her way to the top of the POPCO
   organization and blew the competition away.  Frisken was quoted as saying,
   &#34;<q>She is tongue and tonsils above the rest in her field.  She was the only Poptart
   to have a client suffer death by orgasm.  This will be a real juicy assignment for
   her.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>She comes with an impressive pair of credentials.  Not only was she Torque and
   Friction Queen at the annual Canal Sector Biker Fair, but a swimsuit model for a
   popular monthly men&#39;s magazine.
</p>
<p>Admiral Search at a loss for what to call the new position finally said, &#34;<q>Make
   her Head.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Galactic Know-It-All Admiral Wilhelm Klink, a recent graduate of the Zbigneu Rheal
   School of Vocabulary and Diction where he learned English as a first language, was
   listening nearby.  He confused the verb make for the verb give and the whole room
   was treated to quite a performance.  Klink is recuperating nicely and should be
   released from the hospital soon.  It seems he suffered a sprained neck and erotic
   asphyxiation when Heidi inadvertently crossed her legs.  While in the hospital,
   Klink is writing a song for Ubi Doitchlan&#39;s new musical, entitled &#34;<q>Smells Like
   Teen Tuna.</q>&#34;
