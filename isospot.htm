<dd>Starship <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>.  On that first voyage,
    they battled the not-so-evil <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Who at
    Darathacon &#39;86, and, as part of an elaborate scheme, killed off First
    Officer <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Spot.  For those of you who
    weren&#39;t here, this is what you missed:
</dd>
<dt>Olhora:</dt>
<dd>Ow Lawsey, Massa Spot be daid!   He be daid!  Aunt Jemima!...
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>Last year, the crew of the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span> helped
    the insipid Rabble Alliance defeat the evil emperor and the yucky Derth
    Nader in <span class="publication">The Return of the 
     <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span></span>.  But, as luck would have
    it, and this ship has none, their new weapon, the pharton torpedo, caused
    massive destruction to the  <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>,
    not to mention the Derth Star and the evil empire.  For those of you who
    weren&#39;t here for <strong>that</strong> action-packed episode, here
    is what <strong>you</strong> missed:
</dd>
<dd><br />(Phart, explosion)
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Ok, Jim, now you&#39;ve done it.  You&#39;ve gone and blown that apparently
    uncompleted small moon to kingdom come and ourselves along with it.
    You&#39;ve succeeded in destroying everything you&#39;ve known and loved.
</dd>
<dt>Liz:</dt>
<dd>And you also missed the introduction of our new science officer, Ensign T:

<dd>So, folks, this should all make for a whiz-bang play this year. But probably
    not.  So sit back while the judges do their tallying and think of all the
    better things you could be doing right now, like ...watching the Peopl&#39;s
    Court .. or, the Gong Show, .. or, Best Little House on the Prairie .. or,
    Green Acres .. or, Gilligan&#39;s Island ...
</dd>
<dd><br/>(Fade theme)
</dd>
<dt>(Spot):</dt>
<dd>Help me.  Help me, Jim.  Take me home again.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Bones, did you hear that?
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Hear what, Jim?  (Pause.)  Oh, that.  It&#39;s just the noises from those
    three guys putting the finishing touches on Spot&#39;s old quarters.
    This tub&#39;s almost ready to get underway.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Bones, we&#39;ve got to get back out on his trail before the Amalgamation
    catches up with us.  We&#39;ve got to get these repairs finished quickly.
    I&#39;ve got to find him.
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Relax, Jim, Rleax.  Look, from what Scotch says, these three stooges are
    the best renegade starship repairmen in the galaxy.  Why, when we get
    finished, the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span> will be in a class
    of her own.  Admiral Niagara&#39;s &#34;<q>Edsel</q>&#34; class will be a thing of
    the past.  I like John Delorean&#39;s new Covair design.
</dd>
<dt>Savage:</dt>
<dd>But Admiral, if my recollection is correct, Admiral Nader rejected a similar
    design, saying it was &#34;<q>unsafe at any speed</q>&#34;.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>I don&#39;t recall any such thing, <abbr title="lieutenant">Lt.</abbr>
    Savage.  Anyway, these guys assure me it is the best they&#39;ve got, and
    the quickest to be built.  Don&#39;t you realize the importance of finding
    <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> <abbr title="not now; wait for it">G.</abbr>
    Spot as soon as possible?
</dd>
<dt>Savage:</dt>
<dd>Yes, sir.  If we don&#39;t go after him, these guys have no show.  Besides
    that, I&#39;d like to make sure he&#39;s dead, too, especially after what
    he did to me on Genocide.  (pats stomach.)

<dd>Witness this.  Submitted for your approval -- the plight of one James Tyrone
    Quirk, Admiral of what is left to the <acronym
    title="Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms Starfleet">A.N.A.L.S.</acronym>
    Starship <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>.  His former first mate
    Spot was flushed into space in our first program, and in order to keep his
    superiors from reviving the dead past, Quirk has begun a search across
    space to find the body and utterly destroy it.  Driven by desire, he has
    braved new worlds, sought out old friends, and boldy gone were some men have
    gone before.  He has lost almost everything he knows and loves through the
    use of the thentofore untried Pharton torpedo.  He has brought his ship here
    to be repaired, to be redesigned, to better help his search.  But little
    does he or his crew realize that while persuing this voyage, they have
    taken a wrong turn.  Join them as they go reeling through <span

<dd>Nyukk, Nyukk, Nyukk.  Alright youse guys, the ship is finished.  Who gets
    the bill?
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Send it to the Amalgamation, care of first officer Spot.
</dd>
<dt>Curly:</dt>
<dd>(Pause.)  Oh, I get it! That&#39;s the dead guy.  Wait a minute while I
    figure in some more cost overruns.  (Cash register shtik) Sayonara!!
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>These General Titanics guys sure are swift.  (looks at bill)  And expensive.
</dd>
<dt>(Spot):</dt>
<dd>Jim, take me home.  Take me home.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>It&#39;s that voice again.  Zulu, get us out of here, now.
</dd>
<dt>Zulu:</dt>
<dd>Yes, Cap&#39;n Quirk.  Heading?
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>What do you think he is, a pervert?
</dd>
<dt>Zulu:</dt>
<dd>No, Doctor.  I just wanna know where the hell we&#39;re going.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Scotchy has a theory.  Get the co-ordinates from him.

<dd>You know Jim, Olhora&#39;s right.  Hysterical, but right.  It does sound
    like Spot.
</dd>
<dt>Savage:</dt>
<dd>Admiral, I do recall an ancient Vultron ritual where a Vultron may transfer
    his eternal soul, his... KaKa, to another object or person to be later
    reunited with his body.

<dt>Zulu:</dt>
<dd>Somp&#39;n &#39;bout all this stinks.

</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Dammit, Jim, I&#39;m a doctor, not the Roto-Rooter man....  Wait.. if he
    left it, it&#39;s got to be where he died -- and he drowned while stuck
    to the terlit seat.  It must be in his bathroom.  (Panic:) Oh, no!

<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Listen good, all of you.  I don&#39;t want <em>any</em> part of Spot on

<dd>Aye.  <abbr title="lieutenant">Lt.</abbr> Olhora, would ye get me an open

<dd>(Sound of helicopter)  In 2284, seven conventioneers were convicted by a
    fandom court for a laugh they did not commit.  They promptly escaped from
    the gopher hole of the maximum security prison d&#39;Iberville and escaped
    in the sleeper ship Biloxi Bay, and went to the outer reaches of
    Amalgamated Space.<br />
    If you&#39;re in trouble, if your play needs another plot element and you
    don&#39;t know who to turn to, maybe you can hire the 
    <abbr title="pigeon team (don&#39;t ask)">P-team</abbr>.  But not today,
    because Captain Spot, through the body of Engineer Scotch, has already
    done so.  He has paid them to find his body, and to reunite him with
    it.  Along the way, they found Ensign T, who left the 
    <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span> in search of his immense gold
    chains <span title="that&#39;s thirteen weeks ago to you and me">sixty
    five</span> stardates ago.

    <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Spot&#39;s KaKa.  I have hired a cracked
    team of commando spookbusters to rid my ship of the infestation.  They are
    also bringing Ensign T, who has been Missing In Action since last year&#39;s
    program, thirteen weeks ago ship time.  Thanks to my new security system,
    the Pantyless Field, I now know they have Spot&#39;s body.  I must now keep
    Scotchy away from it, lest Spot&#39;s KaKa be reunited with his body.
    Presently Colonel Panadol, Facemaker, and Drydock are inspecting the ship.

    <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Chapstick puts it, there&#39;s something
    in the oven.
</dd>
<dt>Spot:</dt>
<dd>Mister Savage, as your teacher and mentor, it is my duty to tell you of the
    ancient Vultron proverb which says:  &#34;<q>Take that which you have brought
    upon yourself, and bear the guilt alone.</q>&#34;  Fortunately, I&#39;m not
    pregnant.
</dd>
<dd><br />(Spot and Savage go for neck pinches, Quirk physically intervenes.)
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Ah, well, a happy <strong>end</strong>ing.  We can just cruise about the
    galaxy, and wait ten years or so until they make a movie about us.
    About me.
</dd>
<dt>Cast:</dt>
<dd>(Affirmative responses.)
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Hey, Jim!  You know, this is the first episode we&#39;ve ever gone through
    without you falling in love with a new species of alien woman.  Better do
    something or you&#39;ll lose your reputation.
</dd>
<dt>Savage:</dt>
<dd>But, <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Maloy, there isn&#39;t an alien planet
    except Vultron anywhere around here.  It would be almost a week before we
    could find some bimbo, I mean being for the Admiral.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>By gods, she&#39;s right!
</dd>
<dt>Malden:</dt>
<dd>You&#39;re lost in space, no cash, and you need a woman desperately.
    Who can you turn to?  What will you do?  What <strong>will</strong> you do?
    If you had Amalgamated Express, you could go to any one of over nineteen
    billion starbases for an instant refund, or instant gratification.
    Amalgamated Express.  Don&#39;t leave port without it.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Spot, any suggestions?  Any plots or movies we haven&#39;t made fun of yet?
    How about a miniseries?  How about T. J. Hooker?  There&#39;s got to be
    some material in there!
</dd>
<dt>Spot:</dt>
<dd>Admiral, there is an ancient Disney superstition which may help.  It&#39;s
    called &#34;<q>Wishing upon a star</q>&#34;.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Wishing upon a star??  But Spot, I&#39;m an admiral.
</dd>
<dt>Spot:</dt>
<dd>Captain, it makes no difference who you are.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd><span title="This line was not printed on my script, so I guessed.">Yes, but
    I&#39;m more accustomed to giving orders.  I know! Bones, you make a wish.
    </span>
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Okay, Jim.  Here goes.  Se that one -- over there.  The green one on the
    left.  Watch.
</dd>
<dt>Zulu:</dt>
<dd>(pause)  Admiral, what&#39;s going to happen?
</dd>
<dt>(Bowman):</dt>
<dd>Something wonderful.
</dd>
<dd><br />(Oohs and Aahs from the crew)
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>My God!  The view screen!  It&#39;s full of...
</dd>
<dt>Cast:</dt>
<dd>Bars!  (Chants) Bar-rooms!  Bar-rooms!..
</dd>
<dt>T:</dt>
<dd>Seventeen million, three hundred forty seven thousand and six bars, taverns,
    nightclubs, and casinoes, to be exact, Sucker, Sir.
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Kinda reminds me of Louisiana...
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Why, Bones, you alcoholic son of a...
</dd>
<dt>Scotch:</dt>
<dd>Aye.  Good work, <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Maloy.  It&#39;s about time
    we had a <em>good stiff belt</em>.  Ah!
</dd>
<dt>Savage:</dt>
<dd>But, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Scotch, our pants have elastic
    waistbands...
</dd>
<dt>Spot:</dt>
<dd><abbr title="lieutenant">Lt.</abbr>, what <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
    Scotch is referring to is.. oh, forget it.  Admiral, even <strong>I</strong>
    could use some recreation.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>And they may even have beautiful alien women in those bars.
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Of course, Jim.  That was part of the wish.  Heh, heh.  Ain&#39;t I
    somethin&#39;?
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Come on guys!  You too, Savage.  First round is on Spot.
</dd>
<dt>Spot:</dt>
<dd>Ok, if they&#39;ll cash my back pay check.  By the way, Jim.  What if the
    enemy had decided to surrender?    Even had we used all our personnell,
    the ratio of our boarding parties would have been 1.414 men per ship.
    That&#39;s hardly a force to be reckoned with.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>True, Spot, but remember General Order 42.  Upon meeting an enemy vessel
    in our space, we must order them to surrender.  I was going by the book.
    But the book doesn&#39;t say I have to <strong>allow</strong> them to 
    surrender.
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>So you were going to blast them anyway, Jim?  Why you sly old dog...
</dd>
<dt>Scotch:</dt>
<dd>Aye, that&#39;s my kind o&#39; Captain!
</dd>

<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Heh, Heh.   Ain&#39;t I somethin&#39;?  Let&#39;s go to Tie One On.
</dd>
<dt>Savage:</dt>
<dd>But, Admiral, where is Taiwanon?
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t worry your pretty li&#39;l head about it.  The men folk&#39;ll
    show ya.

<dd><span title="This line was not printed on my script, so I guessed.">
    Take me home now, or lose me forever!</span>

<dd>Cut what out, Admiral?

<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>Submitted for your approval, the flight of the
    <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>.  Given a happy ending, the crew,
    cast, and writers have nothing better to do than get drunk.  Not a bad
    idea, if you ever find yourself Lost in Space.  So, if you ever wish upon
    a star, and find yourself in a bar with this silly cast, beware.  For you
    have just entered <strong>The Budlight Zone</strong>.
</dd>
<dt>(Spot):</dt>
<dd>Space, the next-to-last frontier.  These have been the voyages of the
    starship <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>.  Its dubious mission:
    to create new life out of old television programs, to find new, extravagant
    alien women for the captain to fall in love with, and to give this insipid
    group of amateur actors a chance to go out of state and make fools of
    themselves each year.

<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>Well, Folks, that&#39;s just about it for the crew of the

<dt>Olhora:</dt>
<dd>Would you look at that?!

<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Jim, is that...

<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Yes, gentlemen, the great experiment.  I give you..the

<dd>And if my mother was a birthday cake, she&#39;d have candles.
</dd>
<dt>Spot:</dt>
<dd>Jim, does that mean?...
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Yes, it does!
</dd>
<dt>Savage:</dt>
<dd>Does he mean?
</dd>
<dt>Cast:</dt>
<dd>Yes!  He does!

<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>You can&#39;t mean....

<dt>Zulu:</dt>
<dd>I&#39;m afraid he does.
