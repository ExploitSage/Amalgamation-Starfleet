<h3>ASK DR. FORTRAN</h3>
<h4>by Dr. Pascal Fortran</h4>
<p class="letter24tran">
Dear Dr. Fortran,
</p><p class="letter24tran">
What exactly is a trophy wife?
</p><p class="letter24tran">
Bewildered
</p>
<p>It is a woman that sits around watching soap operas (infomercials, shopping channels)
   all day, wasting away, testing the laws of physics by gaining mass and losing energy,
   and she may or may not get up to put her husband&#39;s dinner in the microwave.
</p>
<p>Oh excuse me!  I misread your letter.  I thought you said <q>atrophy wife.</q>
</p>
<p>When a man becomes rich enough to part with half of his net worth, he trades in the
   old model for a newer low mileage one that is at least twenty years his junior.  This
   <q>trophy wife</q> is displayed much the same way that a person would exhibit a wild
   game animal that was bagged while on safari.  You could also form certain analogies
   using the verb mounted.
</p>
<p>These sleek, sexy models usually have names like Candy, Babette or Ginger and come
   standard with a sporty chassis, short skirt, low-cut or see-through blouse.  Optional
   equipment includes a saline enhanced front suspension, bronze exterior and special
   rally make-over package.  These units are also known to have unusually high upkeep
   and maintenance costs.
</p>
<p>Leasing certain models on a night-to-night basis is not considered having a wife and
   should be avoided for obvious health reasons.
</p>
<p>The trophy wife is a vain attempt by the male to prove his virility to himself and
   his colleagues despite the graying hair or balding head.
</p>
<p>After about five years Candy will wise up and again take him for half of his net
   worth.
</p>
<p>Now there are plenty of successful women in this country.  But you never see them
   parading around showing off a trophy husband.  Why?  That is because that species of
   mammal doesn&#39;t exist!
