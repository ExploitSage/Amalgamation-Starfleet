<h3>ASK DR. FORTRAN</h3>
<h4>by Dr. Pascal Fortran</h4>
<p class="letter24tran">
Dear Dr. Fortran,
</p><p class="letter24tran">
My husband and I have been married for many years.  He now insists the we try
   something new called annual sex.  I think it is perverted to screw around only once
   a year.  Should I submit to his deviant sexual requests?  By the way, I am not
   half-bad looking.
</p><p class="letter24tran">

</p>
<p>Dear Helen,
</p>
<p>I have to ask, what does the other half look like?  But I digress.  I, myself,
   have had annual sex many times in the last year.  The trick is that it has all been
   with different women.  Now on to your problem.  Many women find annual sex a
   pleasurable experience, especially after 4 shots of tequila.  This may not be your
   case, but try the tequila anyway.
</p>
<p>After many years of marriage, men become tried, complacent, and have pretty much
   shot their respective wads.  They start to look for something new, different and
   exciting to invigorate their lives.  Buy him a train set.  This, in itself, won&#39;t
   get you any more sex, but it will keep him at home and he won&#39;t go wandering
   around looking for it elsewhere.
</p>
<p>Now here is what I suggest.  Down 4 shots of tequila.  Dress up wearing only an
   engineer&#39;s cap and a pair of short overalls made out of Saran Wrap.  Fill an oil
   can with K-Y Jelly and tell him you&#39;re there to pull maintenance and service
   his rod.  (A little lubrication on his ball bearings wouldn&#39;t hurt either.)
   Make train whistle sounds every time he parks his engine in the roundhouse.  Or if
   you prefer, he can try the coal tender position.  If he stills insists on annual
   sex, it&#39;s up to you whether or not you let him ride in the caboose.  Remember,
   annual sex is better than no sex at all.
</p>
<p>And as always, no matter what you decide, be sure to wrap that rascal.
