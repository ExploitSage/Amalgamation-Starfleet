<h2>ATTORNEYS TO MAKE A FORTUNE</h2>
<div class="dateline">Lake Sardis, Xanadu, (NIPS)</div>
<p>Chief mouthpiece for the Planets of Pleasure Corporation, Hi Hardwin, began filing
   charges this morning on behalf of POPCO and its employees, agents, detachments and
   attachments against former A.N.A.L. Starfleet Admiral Sam &#39;<q>Screaming Weasel</q>&#39;
   Drucker.  As he is still filing, the exact number of charges remains to be seen,
   but the first thousand include: Breach of Breeches; Impersonation; False Arousal;
   Premature Ejaculation; Lack of Ejaculation; Chronic Impotence; Acute Paranoia; A
   Not-So-Cute Paranoia; Singing While Attempting To Perform Orally; Short Changing;
   Short Shooting; Short Sheeting; Shortcomings; Short Comings; Making a Left Turn In
   The Tulane Sector, Thrusting in a No-Wake Zone; and Chronic Diarrhea.
</p>
<p>Hardwin denied that the charges were for the purpose of importing jurors into the
   Red Star District, saying &#34;<q>Drucker has done a lot of illegal, unlicensed immoral,
   and generally ignorant things around here, and that has pissed a lot of people off,
   most particularly those who don&#39;t like to be pissed off.   More important than
   the millions of jurors and billions of credits they bring is the single fact that
   Drucker wouldn&#39;t dare show his anatomy on a POPCO world again.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>An alert has been sounded.</p>
<h2>DA DREAMS OF DRUCKER&#39;S DEMISE</h2>
<div class="dateline">Vienna, Vienna, O&#39;Bryan   (NIPS)</div>
<p>K. O. Pecktaight, Attorney for the District of Vienna, today filed over 5,000,000
   charges against Sam &#39;<q>Grunge-Bunny</q>&#39; Drucker.  Included in the charges were:
   Littering by Existence; Loitering by Nature; Practicing Vagrancy Without a License;
   Failure to Tip (11,512 charges); Parking in the Left Lane of a Public Spaceway;  and
   4,327,225 separate charges of Endangering the Environment (eds. note: Endangering
   the Environment is a crime against an individual in the O&#39;Bryan System), and
   Practicing the Violin (with a license, but without talent).
</p>
<p>Pecktaight&#39;s only comment to the press was &#34;<q>This guy is toast.  Dry, black
   toast.  I don&#39;t think you could find three sentient beings in the system where
   two wouldn&#39;t kill him before he stands trial.  I love this town!</q>&#34;
</p>
<h2>SAM THE S.M.O.F. SLAMMED</h2>
<div class="dateline">Seed, Sunflougher    (NNN)</div>
<p>Lilly d&#39;Field, Attorney General for the First Trial District (FTD), today
   planted charges in the Hillary Clinton Hothouse against Sam &#39;<q>Sinful Molester of
   Flowers</q>&#39; Drucker stemming from his three-day diplomatic visit last year.  &#34;<q>We
   are quite sure the Amalgamation will deny his diplomatic immunity status.  They are
   just about ready to deny he ever existed,</q>&#34; quoted Ms. d&#39;Field.  Charges in
   the Sunflougher System are not a matter of public record until the accused has the
   chance to file a plea, but we received an anonymous transmission on Hothouse
   letterhead which indicates that the charges include the following: Carnal Knowledge
   of a Rhododendron; Cross-Pollination out of Season; Driving Miss Daisy Without a
   License; Bumbling a Bee; Irrigation in Public; Sowing Wild Oats in a Fallow Field;
   Plowing a Furrow without a POPCO Permit; Gratuitous Emptying of a Silo; Aggravating
   a John Deere; Being Out in Left Field; Transporting an Unripe Melon Across the
   Neutral Ground; Graft.
</p>
<h2>BARS BLOCKED BY A BILLION BARRISTERS</h2>
<div class="dateline">Known Space, (NIPS)</div>
<p>Long lines of lawyers litigated against Sam &#39;<q>Who does he think he is, anyway</q>&#39;
   Drucker in nearly every courthouse in known space.
</p>
<p>Most Clerks of Court were unavailable for comment, but we did get a prepared
   statement from Bumm S. Rush of  Limbar.  &#34;<q>There are so many suits being filed
   against Drucker, we&#39;ve had to open a revolving charge against him.  Even so,
   unless you are charged at least 10,000 credits an hour, you can forget being able
   to file this week.  We&#39;ve got more favors being called in for a place in line
   to file against Drucker than we realized were out there.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Highlights of Known-Space Drucker suits include:  Skortcht Urthe,
   Barrister-at-Large for the Obsidian Empress, I. &#39;<q>Likkem</q>&#39; Bigg, gathered a
   crowd in front of the Juris Marsupius Negrus de Morte and announced: &#34;<q>We are
   charging Drucker, that ivory-stealing mooselicker from Outer Thumbsuck, with
   Writing Rap without a Beat; Crapping on the Come-Out; Loading Eight in a Nine Zone;
   Wearing Penny Loafers; Sale of fine-toothed combs to Obsidian youth; Attempted sale
   of fine-toothed combs to Obsidian youth; Relaxing without a License; Illegal
   Discharge of a Jheri-Curl;  Tugging on Superman&#39;s Cape; Spitting in the Wind;
   Pulling the Mask off the Old Lone Ranger, and messing around with both Jim Walker
   and Slim McCoy.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Shush U. Faise, consiglieri for the Campo Sector, trumped up the following charges
   in the Negro Mano Courthouse:  Failure to kiss the ring, Delivering money in brown
   envelopes; Choking Chickens in a Turkey Zone; Improper use of Fettucine; Illegal
   Use of Speakers Out-of-Phase; Failure to celebrate Christmas in July; Frequent
   Amplitude Modulation; Inample Frequency Modulation; Directing a Single Side Band
   without a Maestro&#39;s License; Ordering Out for Chinese on St. Joseph&#39;s Day;
   Block Conversion; Smoking a Concealed Cigar; Carrying a Violin in a Machine Gun Case;
   and Adding Laundry during the Rinse Cycle.
</p>
<p>When asked if Starfleet was going to jump on the &#34;<q>Pound Drucker into
   Pat&eacute;</q>&#34; band-wagon, Amalgamation Spokes-person Ophealia d&#39; Cleavage moved
   her hands up towards her neck and yelled &#34;<q>THIS IS WAR! -- Just kidding, boys..</q>&#34;
   and re-buttoned her tight-fitting bodice, much to the dismay of panting reporters.
  &#34;<q>Hey, why should we waste time and money beating a dead horse&#39;s ass when the
   rest of the Known Universe, and much of the Rumored Universe is going to do it for
   us and send us the videotape.  See Ya.</q>&#34;
</p>
<h2>DRUCKER BASHING EXPLORED</h2>
<div class="dateline"><em>Compiled using unlimited access to our toll free lines and
   with much intestinal fortitude by staff meteorologist <strong>Dr. Pascal
   Fortran</strong> and galactic know-it-all <strong>Admiral Wilhelm
   Klink</strong>.</em></div>
<p>In an effort to try to find any kind words about Admiral Sam Drucker, this paper
   sent its roving reported, Eva Distruckshin, on assignment to contact anybody who
   might put in a good word for him.  Before collapsing with apathy she filed this
   report.
</p>
<p>His pediatrician: &#34;<q>Some say it&#39;s a rumor, but I know for a fact that just
   before birth he garroted his own twin brother with the umbilical cord.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>His nanny: &#34;<q>I think he&#39;s living proof of reincarnation.  No one can be that
   dumb in one lifetime.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>His kindergarten teacher: &#34;<q>It would be nice if I could trim his fingernails to
   the elbow.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>His high school counselor: &#34;<q>Even though our school was coed, he always had
   trouble getting the girls to come.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>His hairdresser: &#34;<q>He&#39;s such a nice man.  He tips me extra when I leave my
   blow dryer running in his lap.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>His urologist: &#34;<q>He suffers from the involuntary suspension of phallocentric
   activity along with a progressive disorder of the wimp nodes.  And for stiffing me
   with my last bill I&#39;d like to give him a radical prostate massage.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>His psychiatrist: &#34;<q>He seems morally out of the mainstream and unfettered by the
   confines of regular employment.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>His probation officer: &#34;<q>He&#39;s a boil on the butt of the universe.  Once he
   even confessed to the drive-by bayoneting of Joan of Arc.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>The headwaiter at his favorite restaurant, Chez Monyew: &#34;<q>The women he brings
   here are some kind of ugly.  They could make an onion cry.</q>&#34;
</p>
<h2><img src="images/nflash.gif" alt="News Flash: " />DRUCKER AND THE MULE-A AT
   GFF</h2>
<p>   Sam Drucker and The Mule-A were standing in line to register for the Galactic
   Fantasy Fair at Noon on Saturday when suddenly Drucker grabbed a propeller-beanie,
   placed it on his head, and began yelling &#34;<q>I&#39;m a SMOF! I&#39;m a SMOF!!</q>&#34;
   Convention Security chased him off the premises before realizing who he was.
</p>
<h2><img src="images/nflash.gif" alt="News Flash: " />DRUCKER HANGS WITH SHERMAN</h2>
<p>Sam Drucker and William Tecumseh Sherman were seen loitering outside of an
   all-night Nixxon Station last night.
</p>
<p>The couple were swilling beers near the pumps for about two hours, and remained
   unrecognized until Drucker doused himself in a highly unstable Com-Post engine fuel
   and began yelling, &#34;<q>I&#39;m Atlanta!  I&#39;m Atlanta!  Come on, Bill baby, light
   my fire!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Station attendants quickly pulled the fire extinguishing apparatus, and Drucker
   disappeared in a pile of foam.
