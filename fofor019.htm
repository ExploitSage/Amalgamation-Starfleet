<h3>ASK DR. FORTRAN</h3>

<p class="letter24tran">
Dear Dr. Fortran,
</p><p class="letter24tran">
My mother says that if I don&#39;t stop doing IT, I&#39;ll go blind.  What the IT is
   she talking about?

<p>Let&#39;s not diddle around the bush on this one shall we?  What your mother is
   referring to is nude sun-bathing.  Consider the following case studies.
</p>
<p><strong>Case Study #1</strong></p>
<p>George S., a mild-mannered, married school teacher in his early 40&#39;s had taken
   to pruning his hedge with a nail clipper, one leaf at time.  This was a result of
   his neighbor next door, a woman in her mid-30&#39;s, who had started sunning herself
   by her pool, sans suit or any other type of clothing.  This acute arboreal behavior
   pattern had infected Mr. S. every Saturday afternoon since Spring, weather
   permitting.  The woman was aware of this visual intrusion and welcomed ,nay
   encouraged, the voyeuristic proclivities of her neighborly bush trimmer.  Then one
   afternoon though the forces of the universe ganged up on Mr. S.  At the exact same
   time that the female neighbor rolled over onto her posterior, Mrs. S. stood on the
   back porch and tried to gain her husband&#39;s attention by repetitiously calling
   his name.  He was so enraptured by the exhibition across the hedge that he failed
   to hear her.  His auditory faculties had completely abandoned him.  Even when Mrs.
   S. stood directly behind him, uttering various harmonic distortions of a vile and
   slanderous nature, he still did not detect her presence.  It was only after repeated
   applications of a garden trowel upside his head that she corrected this anomaly.
   The coma lasted only a few days and he recovered fully.  Mr. S. has since taken to
   locking himself in the upstairs back bedroom with a pair of binoculars on the
   weekends.
</p>
<p><strong>Case Study #2</strong></p>
<p>Anthony U., a shy, introverted and unmarried man in his late-30&#39;s, was
   employed full-time for a lawn maintenance company as a professional leaf blower.
   He also held a part-time job as a crab stuffer, but that has nothing to do with
   this case study.  In the course of his full-time employment he had the occasion to
   enter the backyard of the house where he was working.  He encountered an attractive
   female in her early-20&#39;s on a chaise lounge engaged in the process of melanin
   augmentation, au natural.  The young lady stood up and without embarrassment for
   her lack of attire approached him.  Anthony U. was not well versed in any sort of
   intimate relationship, let alone the sight of a naked woman.  He was, for all
   intents and purposes, devoid of any initiatory sexual experience.  Attempts at an
   oral response by him was met with only guttural intonations and the occasional
   lecherous groan.  Even when she asked him a direct question pertaining to the
   quality of his viewing pleasure, he failed to respond.  He had lost his capacity
   for verbal communication and was beginning to swoon.  The sight of her had left him
   speechless.  The fast thinking woman quickly hosed him down with cold water from a
   lawn sprinkler.  This seemed to have the desired calming effect, until he caught a
   glance of her again and then the  whole episode started all over.  Even to this day,
   he still babbles incoherently at the sight of any sort of female flesh, an action
   that extremely annoys his few remaining friends.
</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If nude sun-bathing can cause a person to go deaf or dumb, surely going blind, is
   next in the logical progression of events.
