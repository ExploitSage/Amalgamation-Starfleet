<h2>
LAKESHORE, LAKE POMONA<br />
REGION 1812. N.A. FED., EARTH<br />
1-8000-GET-SMART</h2>
<h1>A PRE-HISTORY OF THE A.N.A.L. STARFLEET</h1>
<p>The history of the Amalgamation Starfleet is a sordid one, one which dates back to
   the late 20th Century Limited, the crack passenger train of the New York Central
   Railroad, for it was aboard this train that the idea of the automatic washing machine
   was born.  Or, that&#39;s how the story has been told for two and a half centuries.
   Anyway, in the years following the Flatulagenics Wars (1989-1993), many nuclear
   scientists found themselves out of work, due to the harnessing of the new power
   source, flatulagenisite.  One of these people was Dr. Havoline Pennzoil Edsel.
</p>
<p>Edsel was lucky enough to find work as a washing machine repairman.  As the loneliest
   man in town, Edsel had much time on his hands, and to occupy this time, he developed
   a project in order to keep his research skills well honed.  He settled down to see if
   he could find the answer to a malady which had plagued the populace of the
   industrialized countries since the end of World War II.
</p>
<p>Ever since the automatic washing machine had come into wide use, a phenomena
   manifested for which no explanation could be found.  No matter what precautions were
   taken before putting in a load of clothes to be washed, it would never fail that one
   sock from one pair being washed would disappear.  To those of this century, this may
   seem a bizarre occurrence.  It was, however, a common event in the daily lives of
   20th century man.
</p>
<p>Without getting into the exact Physics involved, the histories tell us that while
   using his spare time at the Maytag Company, Dr. Edsel discovered that during the wash
   cycle of the washing machine, a deviance in normal space-time equivalence would occur,
   if and only if socks were present  in the wash.  With further experimentation, Edsel
   discovered that anything directly attached to the sock would also disappear.
</p>
<p>Edsel immediately sought and was awarded a grant from the Phre4d Hawph School of
   Engineering at the University of Lake Pomona (Louisiana, old United States.)  With
   perseverance, Edsel in two years was able to successfully build and demonstrate a
   crude WaRP drive.  What would seem to be a boom to mankind actually led to the
   greatest disaster the Earth had ever seen.
</p>
<p>The military-industrial complex of the United States, at the behest of then President
   Jim Bakker, attempted to obtain complete control of the WaRP technology.  Since the
   state of Louisiana had funded Edsel&#39;s research in total, Anthony Uchello (then
   Governor, later Dictator of the Free State of Louisiana) laid claim to the drive, and
   all its profitable and research uses.  When the U.S. attempted to seize control,
   Louisiana, with the help of  Nicaraguan Freedom Fighters, began their War for
   Secession.  With the help of the able generals George Spicuzza, Joseph Becker,
   Juan Valdez and T. C. Barthelemy, the Louisianians turned the tide of the war,
   capturing the entire Mississippi Valley and Texas, cutting the U.S. in two.
</p>
<p>Support for the Secession fight soon came from all quarters of the world, but the
   most devastating blow to the U.S. came when the militia of the state of New Jersey,
   under the control of Col. J. B. Trippodo, joined the war, and drove southward to
   capture Washington, DC, the capital of the U.S. This event caused President Bakker to
   order tactical nuclear strikes against the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics
   (now the  Georgian Kingdom) and the United Kingdom (now the Republic of Greater
   Scotland), two countries which were supplying arms to the Secessionists.  Total
   nuclear annihilation seemed inevitable, until the appearance of the Super Weapon.
</p>
<p>During the War, Governor Uchello engaged the services of the radical Physicist
   G. A. Goody Michel, B.S., M.S., Ph.D., L.S./M.F.T., to help build a fleet of
   space-based ships which could help in the Secessionist battles.  During  the
   development procedure, Dr. Michel, along with his brother DeVoid, accidentally
   combined the WaRP output with a standard .5 Watt L.E.D. diode [Radio Shack part
   #LED-6713] and discovered/invented the first MITEJUZ Phazer.  The Secessionist then
   went to work building a small fleet (13 ships) of space ships with the Phazer
   weapons.  Under the heroic and sometimes lucky marksmanship of Admiral
   Betty Eckerle and Captain B. D. Stocker, the Secessionist Space Fleet was able to
   eliminate most of the warheads launched by the major nations of Earth.  Unfortunately
   for Earth, the Louisianians were a few minutes too late to save some of the capitals
   of Earth.
</p>
<p>The presence of this new weapon made any further fighting fruitless, and soon an
   armistice was agreed upon.  Earth finally had its peace, and a new superpower.
</p>
<p>Following the New Orleans Agreements of 1992, the Free State of Louisiana agreed to
   lease their ships to the United Nations for exploration.  Security on Earth was left
   to Louisiana and the several states that joined (or were captured by) Louisiana,
   forming the North American Federation.  The Space Service became involved with
   interstellar exploration in order to find new homes for the desenters, or Unionists,
   of the N.A. Federation.
</p>
<p>Thus, the earliest beginnings of Starfleet can be traced to the North American Space
   Service (No. A.S.S.), which was organized under the direction of Admiral  Eckerle of
   Louisiana, and Admiral Hiawatha A. Niagara of New Jersey.
</p>
<p>As the No.A.S.S. fleet explored the reaches of the galaxy, they found, contrary to
   other estimates, numerous hospitable planets.  Earthers, tired and/or displaced by
   the War of Secession and its subsequent revolutions, streamed forward to settle these
   planets.  Because of the hard feelings caused by the wars, a close association of
   planets never formed.  Their common bind remained in the Space Service, who provided
   protection for the planets and for shipping.
</p>
<p>During the latter part of the 21st  century, a space freighter belonging to the
   Mitsubishi Sector stumbled upon the Vultrons in the F. Combustus System.  The Vultrons
   had P-T-L technology, and had in earlier years contacted many other civilizations.
   For reasons known only to the Vultrons, they suddenly cut off all contacts and
   reverted to their planet.  With the help of No.A.S.S. Admiral C. T. Tumminello, the
   Planets of Earth (as they were then known) opened trade with the Vultrons in 2086.
</p>
<p>As mankind built his space civilization, he came into con tact with other species and
   all began to prosper.  Until, that is, they met up with the Klingfree Empire.  The
   Klingfrees had built a vast militaristic empire over a 300 year period, and, in 2134,
   they developed the Blatz drive, which gave them the ability to travel across the
   galaxy to the human areas.  First contact with the Klingfrees in 2139 led to the
   destruction of the No. A.S.S. ship Hagebush (L.S.S. 7/11), and the capture of the
   planet Whatchamakallit.  As the Klingfrees began to roll over one planet after
   another, Mankind and the other Beings of area realized that no one group alone could
   defeat the Klingfrees.  Modeling an association based on the old Austro-Hungarian
   Dual Monarchy, the planets formed the Universal Radius of Independent Non-Aligned
   Lifeforms, each contributing sums of money and materials to build a Spacefleet and
   the accompanying army which could meet and defeat the enemy.  The U.R.I.N.A.L.s
   decided to utilize the massive facilities of No.A.S.S. as Headquarters, changed the
   name to Starfleet, and set out to kill Klingfrees.
</p>
<p>Starfleet was able to fight a holding action against the Klingfrees, and for two years
   the war was one of attrition.  That phase ended when the Klingfrees launched a sneak
   attack upon Vultron.  Faced with certain destruction, the Vultrons released their
   long-hidden war technology, including the Phazer Banks (member FDIC) and the Brapfire
   engine.  The Brapfire engine gave Starfleet ships supreme maneuverability at sub-light
   speed.  This combined with the Phazer Banks (member FDIC) made Starfleet almost
   invincible.  By 2145 the Klingfrees had been driven from U.R.I.N.A.L. space.  The
   Kobiashi Accords brought a temporary peace with the Klingfrees.
</p>
<p>During the peace the U.R.I.N.A.L. joined with the Obsidian Conglomeration and formed
   the Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms.  The peace lasted, with the exception of
   minor skirmishes on the farthest outposts, until population and expansion brought the
   Amalgamation into contact with the Imperial Remoulade Stupendousness.  The Remoulades
   turned out to be no more friendly to the  Amalgamation than the Klingfrees.  With the
   aid of their Croaking devices, the Remoulade Frogs of Prey were more than a match for
   A.N.A.L. ships.  That is until they made the mistake of attacking the
   Vultrons.  Vultron scientists worked overnight with Starfleet, developing the first
   deliverable energy-based bomb, the Sneezon Torpedo.
</p>
<p>The Remoulades are very pragmatic beings.  Realizing that the Sneezon Torpedo was
   taking a heavy toll on their space fleet, and the fact that for every A.N.A.L. ship
   they destroyed, Lake Pomona Spacedock launched four to take its place, the Remoulades
   suddenly decided to cut their losses, packed up and got the hell out of Dodge.  Since
   then Starfleet has kept a quiet watch on the borders of both Klingfree and Romulaid
   territories.
</p>
<p>The history of Starfleet is not one to brag about.  It has suffered through ineptness
   and mutiny.  There are rare cases of heroics to be proud of.  What has brought most
   victories and accomplishments to Starfleet is just  plain dumb luck, and the fact that
   our enemies have just been more stupid than us.  That is the plain, simple truth.
   Starfleet is nothing to brag about.
