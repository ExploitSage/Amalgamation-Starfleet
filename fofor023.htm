<h3>ASK DR. FORTRAN</h3>
<h4>by Dr. Pascal Fortran</h4>
<p>This last weekend I decided to do some minor home repairs.  I walked into the
   garage to get my hammer.  It was nowhere to be found.  I asked the current
   inhabitants of the household, <q>Where is my hammer?</q>  They replied in unison,
   <q>What hammer?</q>
</p>
<p>This response has now placed me in a quandary and left me with the following
   questions.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Do I have a hammer?</li>
<li>Did I ever own a hammer?</li>
<li>Did it claw its way out of the toolbox and escape?</li>
<li>Does my hammer exits not elsewhere, but elsewhen?</li>
<li>Was my hammer abducted by aliens?</li>
<li>Did Heisenberg borrow my hammer?</li>
<li>Are the hammers secretly in cahoots with the socks in the dryer?</li>
</ol>
<p>Every experiment that I performed could not prove the existence of my nonexistent
   hammer.  I can only hope that my hammer will materialize, on its own volition, in
   some part of my house.
