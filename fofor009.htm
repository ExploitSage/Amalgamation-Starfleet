<h3>ASK DR. FORTRAN</h3>
<h4>by Dr. Pascal Fortran</h4>
<p class="letter24tran">
Dear Dr. Fortran,
</p><p class="letter24tran">
   I am 34 years old white male and a staunch liberal.  Recently I have become engaged
   to a beautiful woman of good breeding with an excellent background.  My own family has
   a closet full of skeletons.  My younger brother is a gay transvestite with a sex
   change operation.  That makes him a man who now is a woman dressing up like a man
   looking for other women.  Or something like that.  The older brother has been
   arrested several times for carnal use of farm animals.  This and his other actions are
   so vile and despicable that everybody in town spits at the very mention of his name.
   My younger sister is a former mob hit woman now turned $1000 a night call girl.  She
   says that working on her back is better than constantly watching it.  The older sister
   is on welfare with three children born out of wedlock.  One white, one black and one
   Chinese.  My father, who died two years before I was born, was cashiered from the Navy
   when a slight navigational error caused him to sail his destroyer into downtown
   Milwaukee.  He eventually found employment as the town drunk.  He died in a tragic
   accident when a meter maid inadvertently drove over him as he lay in the gutter.
   Mother was forced to take a job as a cable splicer on the waterfront in order to make
   ends meet.  She later played the piano in the local brothel, which was owned and
   operated by Grandma.  Grandpa was lynched by an angry religious congregation.
   Actually lynching isn&#39;t how thwy saw it.  They invited him to particapate in a
   public ceremony in which the platform gave way.  Anyway, it seems that after a bad
   Saturday night Mexican dinner, he let loose with a particularly powerful rectal
   effusion the next day in church, blowing out the four pews behind him, killing 4
   members and maiming another 16, setting fire to the curtains and ultimately caused
   the building to burn to the ground.

   My question is this, Dr. Search, should I tell my fiancee that I voted Democrat in
   the last election?
</p><p class="letter24tran">
Baffled
</p>
<p>No, do not tell her!  Some things are better left unsaid and should never be
   mentioned.
