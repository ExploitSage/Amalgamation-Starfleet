<h3>ASK DR. FORTRAN</h3>
<h4>by Dr. Pascal Fortran</h4>
<p class="letter24tran">
Dear Dr. Fortran,
</p><p class="letter24tran">
   Recently, I was in a sports bar with my husband when a minor altercation broke out.
   One of the participants doubled over and in a low agonizing voice tried to yell
   <q>Go Nads!</q>  Is this some kind team or something?

Dear Myra ,
</p><p>
   Yes, you are absolutely right!  The Nads are any one of several ball teams involved
   in stick sports.  The Nads don&#39;t function well under pressure and therefore
   don&#39;t win many major tournaments, so you may not have heard of them.  They are
   one of the few teams that participate in several sports.
</p><p>
   Let me explain the sports that they are most noted for.  Take baseball.  A stick
   trying to hit a ball so that the batter can score.  Swing your stick just right and
   you&#39;ll get a home run.  And then there is golf.  Another stick trying to drive a
   ball into a hole.  If you swing your stick wildly, your ball may not go where you
   want it to go.  To protect the other players you must yell, <q>Fore!</q>  This is
   where the term foreplay comes from.  Don&#39;t forget hockey.  A stick trying to hit
   a flat ball past the goaltender to achieve a score.  And last we have polo.  A mallet
   with a head on it, again, trying to drive a ball.  Team Nads is active in many 
   sports.  All except football.  Excessive consumption of steroids by the players in
   this game has made sticks utterly useless.
</p><p>
   We can see from these examples that while the size of the bat, club, stick or mallet
   are essential to the proper performance in the various games, it is really Team Nads
   that is the driving force behind them.  When push comes to shove, it&#39;s the
   efforts of these unsung heroes that really count.  And remember the next time you
   see the Nads take the field in an exhibition game, go nuts, and yell <q>Go Nads!</q>
