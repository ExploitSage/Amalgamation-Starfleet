<h2>NIAGARA KNOT TIED UP</h2>
<div class="dateline">Lake Pomona, NAFeD, Earth (NIPS)</div>
<p>His Most Supremely Exalted and Gracious Lord Most Highly Glorious Admiral of the
   Fleet, Champion of the Empress of Obsidia, Hero of the Pug Wars and Defender of the
   Catholic Faith Hiawatha L. Niagara was wed earlier this year at ceremonies at the
   Cathedral of Saint Agnes in the Jeffersonian Sector.  His bride is Brigadier
   Admiral Brenda Eloi, Commandant of the Starfleet Junior Cadet Academy in the Milk
   of Agnesia Sector.
</p>
<p>At a press conference yesterday, Starfleet Director of Information Admiral Ophelia
   D&#39;Cleavage made known some of the details of the nuptial.  &#34;<q>Well, if you
   weren&#39;t there, too bad.  It was one hell of a blow out.  The bride was stunning,
   and a few of the guests had to be stunned. All the admirals were gorgeous or
   handsome, or both, depending on their sex or sexual preference.  And, you had to
   see Admiral Bloeda &#39;<q>White Sox</q>&#39; Groeshrees all decked out like Mr. T.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>When asked how this marriage was kept such a secret, D&#39;Cleavage said,
   &#34;<q>Well, boys,  I was so busy with the war, I forgot to tell you.  Sorry.  But
   don&#39;t feel too bad.  Many of Starfleet&#39;s finest missed the event, what with
   the goings on in the Biloxi Bay Sector and trying to clean up  Rubble.  Even Admiral
   Niagara&#39;s best friend, Ubi Doitchlan couldn&#39;t make it.  The damn battries
   in the Schaefer went dead again.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>According to Society Editor Igotta Bleuknows, the gloriously beautiful Contessa
   Vanessa and her champion, Admiral Nuntha &#39;<q>Bud</q>&#39; Weiser presented the newlyweds
   with, a private stay at her palacial palace on Tara.
</p>
<p>Since then, the couple have been seen at many of, the Starfleet Officers Victory
   Parties around the Amalgamation, which, went on with abandon, with many harlots and
   cases of captured Remoulade Stout being consumed.
</p>
<h2>ORDER OF SAINT MITCH PRESENTED TONIGHT</h2>
<div class="dateline">Canus Sanctus, Fiat Lux Sector  (NPS)</div>
<p>The Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms Starfleet will present its highest honor
   tonight at a special ceremory at the Lake Pomona Spacepier Hilton to three of
   Starfleet&#39;s most grand officers.
</p>
<p>Staff Fleet Admirals Zbigneu Rheal, Red C. Pedestrian, and Sir Frisken Search are
   to be inducted into The Order of Saint Mitch at a private ceremony in the
   Admiral&#39;s Suite at the hotel.
</p>
<p>Rheal is being honored for his continued unfailing duty to the Amalgamation and to
   Starfleet.  Admiral Guhd E. Gumdrop once said of Rheal, &#34;<q>No matter where you go,
   there he is, ready to pick up the pieces and get on with the show</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Admiral Pedestrian is being honored for his part in master-minding the Rubble War.
  Admiral Guhd E. Gumdrop was quoted on Pedestrian&#39;s heroics as saying,
   &#34;<q>What with Red pulling deals like this, who needs Drucker anymore.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Honors are bestowed on Admiral Search for his continuing good-will work for the
   peoples of the Amalgamation.  &#34;<q>He deserves it!</q>&#34; bellowed Mega Admiral Doitchlan.
   &#34;<q>With Frisky, you always can find a good laugh, a lunch and or a lay.</q>&#34;
</p>
<h2>RUBBLE WAR LEAVES ENEMIES DECIMATED</h2>
<div class="dateline">Lake Pomona, N.A.Fed, Earth  (NIPS)</div>
<p>Sergeant Major Staff Fleet Admiral Red C. Pedestrian, the leader of the
   Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms slaughter of its enemies, the Klingfrees,
   those now deceased pile of maggot fodder, and the Remoulades, the also deceased
   collection of zit-pus, told the galaxy of the extent of the victory inflicted by
   the Amalgamation upon those aforementioned now dead disputants of galactic peace.
</p>
<p>Pedestrian, quick to grab the spotlight before the rest of the Starfleet High Command
   could sober up, stated, &#34;<q>We have met the enemy, and he is dispersed through space
   like electrons in a cloud.  Our semi-diabolical plan went absolutely
   flawless.  What few Klingfree and Remoulade ships that actually survived the carnage
   are being retro-fitted to be used as bulk transport ships, specifically designed to
   carry anchovy paste.  Prisoners that were lucky enough to be captured, are being
   transported home via the sub-sonic hospital ship S.S. KYVORKEAN.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Admiral Wilhelm &#39;<q>Mr. Microphone</q>&#39; Klink jumped in, saying, &#34;<q>Is this thing on?
  Oh, good!  Look! There weren&#39;t enough Kling ships left to haul ass in.
   They&#39;ll had no choice but to give in to our demands as stated in the Libenstrohm
   Letter being sent with the prisoners.   Now, as for the Rems, there&#39;s not enough
   money in their treasury to pay for the war damages and our expenses for defeating
   them.  If you thought the Treaty of Versailles was bad, wait to you see the details
   of this baby.</q>&#34; 
</p>
<p>Admiral of the Fleet Hiawatha L. Niagara, not showing any signs from his
   intoxicated stupor of the previous night&#39;s festive celebration, proclaimed,
   &#34;<q>Burrrp!  Annexation of the Neutral Grounds  will commence immediately, or as
   soon as I have enough commanders vertical enough to enforce it.  I&#39;ve ordered
   Admiral Sleapz F&#39;Faggs  and his Porneaux Patrol Ships and Admiral Nuntha
   &#39;<q>Bud</q>&#39; Weiser and 82nd Space Dogs to enter the area and begin procuring sights
   and booty, er, supplies.  Admiral  Guhd E. Gumdrop will go in and destroy any
   Benford 2000F&#39;s that haven&#39;t yet exploded, along with any non-A.N.A.L.
   ships.  Admirals Ittaint Muzak and Rip D. Fauhtze have been ordered into the
   Remoulade Sector to blow out, er, up, any of their military bases.</q>&#34;
</p>
<h2>UBI OFFERS AUDITIONS ON HIS ORGAN</h2>
<p>After an abysmally shallow showing for his new GYRO (Get Your Rocks Off) Tour,
   Mega-Admiral Uberall S. Doitchlan, has giving up his career as a composer of gawd
   awful music and now become has started to dabble with choreography.  He and his Goose
   Step Ballet Company are gearing up for their retentive production of Swine Lake.
</p>
<p>To round out the orchestra, he is looking for a female with a excellent grasp of
   organ composition and they must have good rapport with other members of the group.
   Those wishing to apply should appear at the theater, semi-attired, and be prepared
   to come on stage between 2 and 4 p.m.
