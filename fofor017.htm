<h3>ASK DR. FORTRAN</h3>
<h4>by Dr. Pascal Fortran</h4>
<p class="letter24tran">
Dear Dr. Fortran,
</p><p class="letter24tran">
What causes thunder and lightning?
</p><p class="letter24tran">
Rebecca in Provo
</p>
<p>Lightning is cause by aliens using giant flash photography to take pictures of
Earth from space.  While they may have mastered intergalactic space travel, they
haven&#39;t perfected the rechargable flash.  They still use the old Blue Dot
   technology and when these things misfire a bolt of energy actually shoots through
   space and strikes the ground.  This is much better than the previous Flash Powder
   technology.  It is theorized that a colossal miscalculation in the amount of powder
   to be used was actually the cause for the extinction of the dinosaurs.
</p>
<p>Thunder is also caused by space aliens..  These creatures are notoriously bad 
drivers (flyers?).  They are either too busy smiling for the camera or putting on
   their makeup in the rear view mirror to pay attention.  They keep bumping into the
   clouds in the upper atmosphere and rear-ending themselves.  This bumping sound you
   hear is what you call thunder.
</p>
<p>Why hasn&#39;t the normal populace ever seen space aliens?  It&#39;s because they
   are just too embarrassed to land on Earth in their dented ships.
