        COURT GIVES NOD TO STOCKER!</span>
</h1>
<h2>WRITE-IN BALLOTS THROWN OUT!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Lake Pomona, NAFed, Earth  (NIPS)</div>
<p>In what has to be the positively most extraordinary, nay, fantastic, nay,
   unbelievable story ever to appear in this paper in the last month, we are stunned to
   report that Starfleet Admiral Nuntha &#39;<q>Bud</q>&#39; Weiser received the majority of the
   votes cast in last night&#39;s election for the office of Amalgamation Pro-consul.
</p>
<p>Billions of eligible voters across the galaxy wrote in the name of the popular
   admiral on their ballots, giving Weiser a 0.00012% victory margin over incumbent
   Jack Stocker.
</p>
<p>But, in the usual bizarre turn of fate that usually accompanies stories such as
   these, the Amalgamation High Court quickly reviewed the results and the ballots, and
   with in minutes of Weiser&#39;s victory, nullified over 1.6 billion ballots,
   claiming that the ballots all had misspelled &#39;<q>Nuntha</q>&#39; on them, making said
   ballots void.
</p>
<p>Victory was then celebrated in the Stocker camp, where supporters quickly over came
   their shock as the Amalgamation office of Elections and Motor Vehicle Registration
   delivered the good news along with 200 cases of Niagara Amber Bock beer.
</p>
<p>Pro-Consul Stocker made himself available to the press before giving his victory
   speech.  When asked about the strange turn of events of the night, Stocker said,
   &#34;<q>Well, when you&#39;ve been in this office as long as I have been, nothing seems
   strange when it comes to Amalgamation politics.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>When asked about his other opponents, Stocker replied, &#34;<q>Opponents? What
   opponents?  Do you know their names?</q>&#34;  Reporters were left speechless.
</p>
<p>Stocker then spoke to the over 100,000 supporters that had gathered in the Lake
   Pomona Holiday Inn and Convention Center, saying, &#34;<q>I am proud to say the people of
   the Amalgamation have bought the best Pro-Consul that money can buy.  A balanced
   budget and an unbalanced Pro-Consul- What more could anyone ask for?</q>&#34;  Stocker
   then told supporters he had been in a long conference just preceding the election
   results, and was going to retire to his villa for the night.  &#34;<q>We have six more
   years of work to do!  Have some beer, then let&#39;s get back to work!  But remember,
   I won&#39;t vote to pay for another hangover holiday!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Final totals, as approved by the High Court, show Stocker garnering 55.6982% of the
   vote, with Weiser getting 44.30%.  The other candidates received a combined total
   of .0018% of the ballots cast.
</p>
<p>When asked of his feelings on the election turnout, Admiral Weiser told reporters,
   &#34;<q>I was shocked at the news for the High Court!  I didn&#39;t even know people were
   voting for me.  Anyway, I would not have accepted the job, simply because my
   position with Starfleet is far too lucrative, I mean dear to my heart!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Admiral of the Fleet Hiawatha M. Niagara, who by law has had to stay out of
   anything to do with the election, was finally able to speak on the subject.  Said
   the Lord High Admiral, &#34;<q>I have known Pro-Consul Stocker for many years, and have
   had the privilege to work with him since the demise of my predecessor.  I can say
   that the people of the Amalgamation can rest assured that we will continue to
   operate business as usual.  Just ask the Carsailsmians.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Algonquin J. Calhoun, candidate from the Mystic Knights of the Sea, was unavailable
   for comment.  However, when told that Calhoun may be asked by Pro-Consul Stoker to
   serve as SemiPro-Consul, Calhoun&#39;s campaign manager, George &#39;<q>Kingfish</q>&#39;
   Stevens exclaimed, &#34;<q>Whoa, Andy!  For once we may be getting a piece of the pie
   with out you havin&#39; to put your fingers in it!</q>&#34;
</p>

<h2>CARSAILSMIANS DEAL!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Pawpaw, Lammark, Benson System (NIPS)</div>
<p>More good news came from the systems of the Carsailsmian Empire tonite, news that
   a peace treaty had been struck with the Amalgamation&#39;s new-found neighbors.
</p>
<p>Ambassador Yueg Gazzongas reported via subspace radio to the Rhondstat this morning
   that the Carsailsmians had agreed to terms involving territorial rights, borders,
   free trade and non-aggression.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>It was a tough session,</q>&#34; reported Gazzongas, &#34;<q>and in the end, we had to
   give a little.  But, the Carsailsmians have agreed to a slight expansion of our
   borders into areas that they had claimed, I return for territory from the
   Amalgamation.  Admiral Niagara has told me that his fleet is ready to hand over the
   territory almost at once.  We may have a lasting peace with our new neighbors.</q>&#34;
</p>
<h2>SCHAEFER WARMED UP!!!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Pluto, Solar System  (NPI)</div>
<p>Workers were scurrying to jump start Starfleet&#39;s largest ship, the Schaefer
   class Dreadnought A.S.S. DR.DOO, SOB-2000, as it will see immediate duty in the
   turning over of territory to the Carsailsmians.
</p>
<p>Mega-Admiral Uberal S. Doitchlan, who is in charge of the venture and territory
   swap, said that he will be underway in minutes, and that within hours, the DR. DOO
   will be in Carsailsmian space, delivering the new territory to the
   Amalgamation&#39;s southern neighbors.
</p>
<p>When asked exactly what territory would be turned over to the Carsailsmians, Ubi
   reported, &#34;<q>Well, you remember the Rubble War?  And how, we towed that moon with
   us?  Hehehe... Gazzongas promised the Carsailsmians a &#39;<q>fair-sized chunk of the
   Amalgamation.</q>&#39;  So, Admiral Niagara and Pro-Consul Stocker have agreed to deliver
   &#39;<q>a fair-sized chunk</q>&#39; to them, namely the former Klingfree moon of Proctus!
   I think you&#39;d agree that that rock is &#39;<q>a fair-sized chunk</q>&#39; of our
   territory.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Ubi then left for his ship, warning reporters and Carsailsmians alike, &#34;<q>Look out
   for the moon!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Admiral Sleapz F&#39;Faggs is reported missing at this time.</p>
<h2>EEYUP-AKAINE NUPTUIALS PERFORMED!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Lake Pomona,, NAFed., Earth (NNN)</div>
<p>Starfleet Amiga Jim &#39;<q>Beam</q>&#39; Eeyup, recently cited for discovering the ghost
   of the late Hiawatha L. Niagara, was wed to Lady Hurr Akaine last night in a
   semi-private ceremony at the Cathedral of Saint Odo of Cluny here in Lake Pomona.
</p>
<p>The bride, who was dressed for her dream night in a stunning gown by renowned
   designer, Tridis Ahnhunny, is the daughter of Ambassador Sir Gymme and Duchess Lan
   Akaine.
</p>
<p>The couple was absolutely over-awed by the ceremony performed by Reverend
   Thizplaeciz F&#39;Faggs, brother of Starfleet&#39;s lunar Admiral Sleapz F&#39;Faggs.
</p>
<p>Keeping with tradition, the Amiga&#39;s attendants were all Starfleet officers,
   namely the stately Admiral Red C. Pedestrian, who sported a new hair-do for the
   occasion, and  Admiral Guhd E. Gumdrop, wearing a new Babbelon five piece uniform.
</p>
<p>Following the ceremony, the couple treated a few of their closest friends to a
   private dinner, and then embarked on their honeymoon on the Amiga Eeyup&#39;s home
   planet

<div class="disclaimer"><span class="publication">The AMALGAMATION&copy;, etc.</span>,
   is the official newspaper of the Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms
   Starfleet&copy;&trade;, and is published by Niagara Publishing Corporation, a wholly
   owned subsidiary of Niagara Industries, Limited.&trade;  This is an original work of
   humorous fiction, created and written by the members of the Amalgamation of
   Non-Aligned Lifeforms Starfleet, science fiction fandom&#39;s most dysfunctional
   organization ever.  The editors would like to thank our good friend Dr. Jack
   Stocker for his willingness to cooperate and contribute to this issue and scenario.
  We remember that if it wasn&#39;t for him, the Amalgamation would not exist.  Thank
   him if you like this stuff, blame us if you don&#39;t.
