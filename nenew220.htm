<h2>BOOBYPRIZE RETRIEVES SHEEP STATION!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Henson Memorial Command Center, Lake Pomona, NaFed, Earth-
   (NIPS)</div>
<p>Admiral James Tyrone Quirk and the illustrious, heroic and sometimes inept crew
   of the Amalgamations most notorious and oft-ill-fated Edsel-class Battle-wagon,
   DYF-0151-A, A.S.S. BOOBYPRIZE, returned just yesterday, from a galaxy a bit to close
   to home, with an experimental relic, the sheep-breeding station Baa Baa Lawn 5IVE
   in tow.
</p>
<p>The Baa Baa Lawn station was part of an elaborate subterfuge, the highly- secret-
   but- never- deadly  Spacio- Husbandric Embryo- Enlargement Project, developed by the
   devious yet oh-so-studly Reichsfieldmarshall Greg Shepherd in response to Admiral
   Dakkar Keapz Stalin&#39;s cornering of the sheep futures market.
</p>
<p>Speaking for RFM. Shepard, Leftendant Skip d&#39;Records explained to reporters,
   &#34;<q>Well, this is a project so gigantic in scope and so ludicrous in reality as to
   boggle the minds of most Klingfrees.  The plan involved sending back in time five
   space stations specially designed to breed sheep at a pace faster than the
   proverbial rabbits. Then, a starship would return to a less-distant past, recover
   the stations, and bring them back to the future.  The purpose was to breed enough
   sheep in the past and bring them back to our time in a hope to break the monopoly
   held by the Fantasmagoric Fifth Fleet.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>d&#39;Records continued, saying, &#34;<q>Two weeks ago we set the project into motion,
   and yesterday, the BOOBYPRIZE returned with the Baa Baa Lawn 5IVE station, which was
   able to breed and stockpile over five billion sheep.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>The BOOBYPRIZE was unable to locate any of the other stations,</q>&#34; reported
   d&#39;Records.  But the experiment on board Baa Baa Lawn 5IVE was so successful, we
   should be able to break Admiral Stalin&#39;s monopoly on the sheep futures market.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>What?</q>&#34; said d&#39;Records, when he heard an annoying outburst from one of
   the reporters.  &#34;<q>What do you mean he doesn&#39;t have the monopoly anymore?  He
   sold it when?  God, I hope my good friend Sam Drucker didn&#39;t have any part in
   that buy out.  I wonder who tipped of that SOB?</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>d&#39;Records was quickly de-cued by the BOOBYPRIZE&#39;s chief surgeon, Dr.
   Leonhard &#39;<q>Bones</q>&#39; Maloy, who, when asked about the missing stations, said,
   &#34;<q>Dammit, I&#39;m a doctor, not a vet.  The closest I come to dealing with sheep
   is Spot&#39;s damn Vultron anatomy.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>The BOOBYPRIZE&#39;s first officer, Captain G. Spot, deftly elbowed his way to
   the microphone and spaketh to the members of the Fourth Estate, there assembled.
   &#34;<q>Ladies, gentlemen and... whatevers,</q>&#34; he spoketh. &#34;<q>we knoweth not yet
   wherefore said elusive unrediscovered stations be.  Methinks, for I dareth not to
   guess, that these absent four have befallen upon some misbegotten tragedy.
   Forsooth...</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Spot was suddenly and correctly replaced by the BOOBYPRIZE&#39;s chief engineer,
   Capt. Montgomery Ward Scotch, who said, &#34;<q>I dinna kin what that green-blooded
   pointy-eared fool was a sayin&#39;, but in plain English, we ain&#39;t a-tellin&#39;
   a&#39;cause we-un&#39;s don&#39;t know.</q>&#34;</p>
<h2>TRADE BOARD TIZZY CAUSES TUMBLE</h2>
<div class="dateline">Isle of Canned Fruits, Schwegmann, Superstore Sector-   (NBN)
</div>
<p>The Bayou Placid Board of Trade was in a veritable tizzy today as sheep futures
   plummeted on receipt of the news of the recovery of the Baa Baa Lawn 5IVE breeding
   station.  Fourteen traders reportedly expired due to strokes or coronary arrests in
   the pits between 12:42 and 12:46 this afternoon.  Most of this was in the process
   of selling futures purchased just yesterday from Admiral Stalin  by the some- what-
   unnamed consortium.
</p>
<p>Skru Ewe, Senior Vice-President of Sanitary Supplies and the highest-ranking
   conscious executive with the firm of Sheersome Fleesome Brothers, agreed to answer
   reporters questions.  Robin Garlandette, ace reporter for the AMALGAMATION, etc.,
   asked, &#34;<q>Hey, Ewe, I mean, Skru Ewe, what&#39;s your take on the Baa Baa Lawn 5IVE
   issue?</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Ewe replied, &#34;<q>A lot of people are getting their butts wiped today.  It seems
   like the only winners in this deal are Admiral Stalin and Groeshrees and Sons, who
   handled the original deal.  Makes you wonder if whether Admiral Groeshrees used his
   contacts with Admiral Stalin to help his family&#39;s business...</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Suddenly, a large external cerebral hemorrhage seized Ewe, proceeded by a loud
   &#34;<q>bang</q>&#34;.  Admiral Uberal S. Doitchlan, who just happened to be in the crowd,
   stepped up to the microphone and calmed the ensuing riot by telling people that
   full refunds would be offered for all persons still holding ticket to last
   night&#39;s botched UbiMania Concert.  Ubi, looking down at the obliterated body of
   Mr. Ewe, said, &#34;<q>Damn, this must be a high-stress job!</q>&#34;
</p>
<h2>HAIL-MARY GETS SOULS BACK!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Grand University Of Lake Pomona, NAFed, Earth -  (NNS)</div>
<p>At 1:51 yesterday afternoon, a Seeking- Comet Uni- Dimensional (SCUD) missile was
   fired from the primary launch pad and occasional incinerator smokestack at the Grand
   University of Lake Pomona School of Rocketry and Histrionics.
</p>
<p>The missile went unchallenged through the atmosphere and homed in on the tail of
   the recently re-named Hail-Mary comet.  The Hail-Mary comet, most recently known as
   the Hale-Boggs comet, which had also recently been known as the Hail-Caesar comet,
   the Hail2-Dacheeph comet, and in some sectors known as the Baby-Bopp comet, among
   others, was the recipient of the re-suspended and re-expelled souls of the 39
   members of the Brotherhood of the Pearly Portals.
</p>
<p>Chattenwyth L Viss, SFTD at GULP, related that the findings by the team led by
   Admiral Guhd E. Gumdrop indicated that &#34;<q>simulations of reconstruction with a wide
   variety of input variables, including saccharine, aspartame, cyclamates, and
   phenobarbital, revealed that the 39 beings would be more obnoxious than Rush
   Limbaugh with terminal flatulence, more obtuse than Hillary Clinton without makeup,
   and more useless than tits on a castrated rooster.</q>&#34;  Said Viss,  &#34;<q>We determined
   that they were the forefathers of the Scooba Doobas, so we sent them home.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Stepping in to the limelight, which quickly changed hues, Galactic Know-It-All
   Wilhelm Klink, also a member of the research team, spoke to reporters, sayin,
   &#34;<q>Is this thing on?  OK.  If they hadn&#39;t found a heavenly reward while their
   asses have been in space for 300 years, we&#39;re not going to give them another
   chance at an earthly reward.</q>&#34;
</p>
<h2>NOSSIPH A NO-SHOW!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Doenitz Arena, Lebensraum, Das Secktor- (NPI)</div>
<p>Phre4d Nossiph, featured performer of Ubi-Mania, a long-running unauthorized but
   gratuitously acknowledged tribute to the words and music of the galactically-renowned
   part-time musical genius and full-time scourge of the galaxy A.N.A.L. Starfleet
   Mega Admiral Ubi Doitchlan, failed to show for the opening of his tenth annual tour.
</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Doitch-Heads booed at the tops of their lungs (or gills
   in some cases) when substitute performers Bratco took to the stage.  Bratco is a new
   group made up of  Bonne Bon Gumdrop, Stride Rite and Buster Brown Pedestrian, Toe
   and Goeaux Klink, Cub Bob Morgan,  Fem Drucker, Geaux Braughs, and &#39;<q>Duzzy</q>&#39;
   Dicker.
</p>
<p>Luftwaffe Doitchlan, son of the famous Mega-Admiral, incited a riot when he joined
   the group on stage, removed his Huggies Pull-ups, and lofted them into the crowd,
   bombing the audience to the opening strains of  &#34;<q>Odor of 101 Dalmatians</q>&#34;.
</p>
<p>Miraculously, no one was killed, and only threes thousand were wounded, most by
   the initial sortie.  There was only one arrest in the incident, that of Phre4d
   Nossiph, who was not present at the time.
</p>
<h2>UBANGMEES   FIRE!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Henson Memorial Command Center, Lake Pomona, NAFed., Earth-
   (NPI)</div>
<p><strong>This just in:</strong>  Reports from the Magnificent Seventh Fleet, under
   the command of Admiral Wil E. Dicker, say that the Ubangmees have fired upon the
   A.S.S. EXCOMUNICATION, the flag ship of the fleet, and flag ship for Admiral of the
   Fleet Hiawatha M. Niagara.  Starfleet Information Officer Admiral Ophelia
   d&#39;Cleavage has just spoken to reporters, where she said, &#34;<q>Well, boys, you
   know what this means!</q>&#34;  She then opened her tunic, showing off the latest in
   lingerie from Contessa Vanessa&#39;s Secret collection.  Emergency crews were sent
   in to mop up the drool.
