<p>Sr. Chief of Staff, Adm. Red C. Pedestrian, Lt. Sgt. Maj. St Flt. Adm. Guhd E.
   Gumdrop, and Sgt. Maj. St Flt. Adm. Dakkar Keapz Stalin stumbled upon the
   Admiral&#39;s body in a private room in the offices at the Jim Henson Memorial
   Command Center early this morning.  The three admirals would say nothing officially
   to the press.  However, Galaxy-Renowned Know-It-All Sgt. Maj. St Flt. Adm. Wilhelm
   Klink was quoted as saying, &#34;<q>Is this thing on?  OK. He had more holes in him than
   Dr. Carl Weiss.  Whoever shot him was either <strong>really</strong> pissed at him,
   or a gang of assassins, or a hyperactive trigger man with an advanced case of
   epilepsy.  I personally lean toward the Drucker Theory.  See you later, I&#39;ve
   got a funeral to plan.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Niagara, bride of just a decafortnight, began to make a statement, but was
   ignored by reporters.
</p>
<h2>OBITUARIES</h2>
<p><strong>HIAWATHA L. NIAGARA,</strong> Admiral of the Fleet of Starfleet and Chief
   Executive Officer of Niagara Industries, Ltd. died on Stardate 9430.39 in his
   offices at the Jim Henson Memorial Command Center, Lake Pomona, NAFed, Earth. at the
  age of 64.
</p>
<p>Admiral Niagara, holder of numerous titles, had served the universe as Admiral of
   the Fleet of the Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms Starfleet for over 32 years,
   and had been at the helm of NIL, the Known Universe&#39;s largest known industrial
   giant, for the same length of time.
</p>
<p>Niagara was the eleventh clone of Hiawatha Alvin Niagara, Starfleet&#39;s first
   Admiral of the Fleet.  Hiawatha A. Niagara also founded Niagara Industries, Ltd.,
   when he obtained the sole rights to the patents for all WaRP drive technology.  He
   also initiated the contract with the Amalgamation&#39;s predecessors that reserves
   the position of Admiral of the Fleet for the Niagara clones.  The Niagara selection
   as Admiral of the Fleet is also insured by the fact that all Starfleet officers are
   given free shares in NIL, whose hefty annual dividends are warmly accepted by the
   officers and make Niagara warmly accepted as their chief.
</p>
<p>It was under Hiawatha L. Niagara that Starfleet has seen the most progress and
   victories in its history.  At the time of his death, he had almost been able to
   remove the stigma of &#39;<q>Lucky Bumbling Idiots</q>&#39; from Starfleet&#39;s image.
</p>
<p>Admiral Niagara is survived by his wife of four months, Admiral Brenda Niagara,
   head of the Starfleet Junior Cadet Training School in the Milk of Agnesia Sector.
   He is also survived by the most recent Niagara clone, Hiawatha M. Niagara, and by
   Admiral William E Dicker, his son who is rumored to have been sired from a brief
   tryst with the late night club singer, Jessica Rabbit.  There are also hundreds,
   nay, thousands of family ties with the many offspring of the Niagara clones.
</p>
<p>Following a full investigation by the Lake Pomona Coroner&#39;s Office, the LPPD,
   the 82nd Space Dog Strike Force, the Amalgamation Royal Marines, the Society for the
   Prevention of Cruelty to and by Admirals, the Rhondstat Office of Budgetary
   Management and the Papal Office of Investigation, an Irish wake and state funeral
   will be held.</p>
<p><strong>VERNON MICHEL,</strong> a.k.a. James Tyrone Quirk, one of the founding
   fathers of the Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms Starfleet, died at the age of
   26.
</p>
<p>At the young age of 16, Vernon, a.k.a. Derek, was drafted by members of the
   Survivors of the Big Bang, the University of New Orleans Science Fiction and Fantasy
   Club, to play the role of the hapless, hopeless and womanless Captain/Admiral James
   T. Quirk in the radio play &#34;<q>The Wrath of a Con</q>&#34; at Coast Con in 1984.  It was
   in this play that the world was introduced to the Amalgamation of Non-Aligned
   Lifeforms Starfleet.
</p>
<p>Vernon went on to play the role of Khan Solo, galactic pirate, pain in the butt of
   the Evil Empire, and secret lover of Princess Delaya Orgasma, in
   <strong>SOB&sup2;</strong>&#39;s 1985 production of &#34;<q>The Return of the
   Boobyprize</q>&#34;.
</p>
<p>He resurrected the role of James Quirk in &#34;<q>The Search For Spot</q>&#34; at Coast Con
   in 1986. as his hapless crew found the body of Mr. Spot and returned his Kaka to it.
</p>
<p>In 1988, Vernon became a charter member of Starfleet as the former
   <strong>SOB&sup2;</strong> gang created the present group, The Amalgamation of
   Non-Aligned Lifeforms, bringing in his character of James Tyrone Quirk as a
   Starfleet Admiral and member of the Magnificent 7th Fleet.
</p>
<p>Vernon is survived by his fiance, Priscilla, ,his daughter, Stacy Lynn, his
   mother, Carol Michel, his brother, Gus &#39;<q>Admiral Guhd E. Gumdrop</q>&#39; Michel, and a
   host of relatives and friends.
</p>
<p>Rest in peace.</p>
<h2>DRUCKER RESIGNS RESIGNATION</h2>
<div class="dateline">Lake Pomona, NAFed, Earth  (NIPS)</div>
<p>Intergalactic whipping boy and the man with the golden rod, Sam &#39;<q>24 Carat</q>&#39;
   Drucker last week begged (the now late) Admiral of the Fleet H. L. Niagara and the
   Starfleet High Command to accept the resignation of his earlier resignation of his
   command in Starfleet.
</p>
<p>Drucker, obviously weary from being on the run from various police and legal
   agencies who have been hot on his tale since he lost his immunity with his
   resignation, interrupted a training conference being held at the Lake Pomona
   Spaceport Hilton and Convention Center with his pleas and offerings of free beer.
   It took at least one billion nanoseconds for the High Command to reinstate Drucker.
</p>
<p>Many of the Admirals attending and/or hosting the conference, were aghast with
   pleasure at this turn of events.  Starfleet Chief of Staff Red C. Pedestrian was
   weeping with glee.  &#34;<q>Sam&#39;s return sure makes life a lot easier for me.  We
   always need someone with his character and reputation in a command position.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Admiral Guhd E. Gumdrop likewise was happy with Drucker&#39;s return.  &#34;<q>There
   are certain situations which we always engineer, I mean, er, run into that call for
   a man like Sam.  It&#39;ll be good to have the old weasel around again.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Admiral Lady Slong Deray was less enthusiastic, but also welcomed his return.
   &#34;<q>To tell the truth, without Drucker to kick around, life was getting pretty dull.
   I mean, when the next caper comes up, who&#39;s gonna be our fall guy?</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>The lone voice of negativism could be found in Admiral Rip D. Fauhtze.  &#34;<q>Look the
   guy&#39;s a bigger scum than my son!  Who needs him, anyway?  We could pick on
   someone else, like Klink or Stalin, or that pompous little C. Yousetu Later.
  PHHFFFT!  That&#39;s what I think of Drucker.  Niagara shouldn&#39;t trust him.  I
   think he&#39;s in cahoots with someone.</q>&#34;
</p>
<div class="disclaimer">This issue of <span class="publication">The AMALGAMATION&copy;,
   etc.</span>, is mostly fiction.  The editors try to make light of a world that all
   too often is too damn serious and too damn real.  Remember, Life&#39;s too short to
   worry about the big things.  (At least, that&#39;s what most of us guys would like
   the girls to believe.)  As Admiral Dakkar Keapz Stalin would say, &#34;<q>Some men dream
   thing that never were and say &#39;<q>Why not.</q>&#39;  I see things the way they are and say
   &#39;<q>What the F**k??!</q>&#39;</q>&#34;
