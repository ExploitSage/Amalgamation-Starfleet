<h2>DICKER IN GOOD HEALTH!</h2>
<div class="dateline">In the Hoelda Mayo Sector, Remoulade Space (NIPS)</div>
<p>Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms Starfleet Admiral Wil E. Dicker was freed
   just moments ago by Admiral Sir Frisken Search and elements of his Fantabulous
   Fifteenth Fleet.  Dicker was reported to be in good shape in spite of being readied
   by his captors to be encased in Lucite.
</p>
<p>The Invincible First Fleet, under the command of the galactic daredevil Admiral
   Rip. D Fauhtze, and Admiral Search&#39;s fleet, broke through the defenses of the
   Remoulade planet Hero Sheemah, and effected the rescue with out an Amalgamation
   casualty.  Remold losses total 160,739 dead, and 2 wounded so far.
</p>
<p>Using the cover of the new Coanuv Silencer, Admiral Rip D. Fauhtze slipped into
   orbit around Hero Sheemah, where the fleet obliterated the small Rem fleet defending
   the planet.  &#34;<q>The new Silencer developed by Admirals Muzak and Klink worked
   swell!</q>&#34; reported an explosive Fauhtze.  &#34;<q>Even Frisky was surprised.  The Rems,
   those particulate globules of maggot afterbirth, didn&#39;t know we were there till
   we fired our first shot.  And as usual, it was too late them.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Admiral Search then reported on the rescue mission.  &#34;<q>Well, after Faughtze
   finished, we moved in.  We knew how to find him, because Wil E. wears a special
   brand of jockey shorts from Maid Enform Braughs &#39;<q>Real Man</q>&#39; collection, which
   contain Valiumium fibers.  The carrier SIGNAL (SIK-1544) locked on with her
   transporters, as the rest of my fleet through down a coupla hundred Pharton
   torpedoes as a warning.  Couldn&#39;t have done it as well without Fauhtze in my
   rear! I&#39;m bringing  Dicker home now.</q>&#34;
</p>
<h2>FLEET TO PUNISH REMS!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Henson Memorial Command Center, Lake Pomona, NAFed, Earth
  (INN)</div>
<p>&#34;<q>Like my late predecessor, I don&#39;t make idle threats!</q>&#34; blared Admiral
   of the Fleet Hiawatha M. Niagara. &#34;<q>I told the REMS to beg my forgiveness or else,
   and I mean it.  They have five hours to respond, or I will order my fleet to rain
   destruction unseen since the Ubangme War.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Following that statement, Starfleet Chief of Staff Admiral Red C. Pedestrian
   stepped up to the mike.  &#34;<q>If you thought making a star go nova was bad, you
   ain&#39;t seen nothing yet.  By the way, have any of you guys seen the
   A.S.S. ARIZONA lately?</q>&#34;, Pedestrian said with a wink.
</p>
<h2>UBI COMES OUT AHEAD</h2>
<div class="dateline">Aitto Dabarr, Riff  (NIPS)</div>
<p>The latest lyrical endeavor of Uberall S. Doichlan faced stiff resistance and
   almost went down the tubes when investors pulled out.  But a sudden spurt of new
   seed money saved the production.  The naughty nautical musical comedy entitled,
   &#39;Save That Seaman&#39;, opened last week at Arsenio Hall to aroused audiences
   and already the competition has been blown away.
</p>
<p>It is the story of Melvin Pudwhacker, a naval enlisted man, who overcomes his
   self-indulgent and celibate lifestyle onboard the A.S.S. WANKER.  The opening song
   &#39;It&#39;s My Dick And My Soap And I&#39;ll Wash It As Fast As I Want&#39; is
   sure to be a crowd pleaser.
</p>
<p>It is here that he meets the lovely and nymphatic Amber Deckstreeus.  She convinces
   him to give up his masturbatory ways in favor of heterosexuality by taking an active
   hand in his development, complete with several oral admonishments.
</p>
<p>The plot may be hard to swallow but the musical really is based loosely on the
   sticky and degenerate life of Dakkar Keapz Stalin.
</p>
<p>The only drawback to the whole show is that, due to the nature of the performance,
   the female lead mumbles most of her lines.
</p>
<p>Critics says that Doichlan&#39;s music sucks and is mindless drivel, but his fans
   know that it is much less than that.

<h2>DAKKAR KEAPZ STALIN:<br />MAN, MYTH OR BIOLOGICAL MISTAKE</h2>
<div class="dateline">An Investigative Report by Crystal Chanda Lear (NIPS)</div>
<p>Few people know and most just don&#39;t give a damn about the life of Admiral
   Dakkar Keapz Stalin.  The Admiral hasn&#39;t been seen in many months and some
   beings are, well, very thankful for it.  This reporter took it upon herself to
   research that swarthy dreg of humanity.  Where facts were lacking articulate
   fabrications have been used instead.
</p>
<p>He was supposed to be an only child, but when his parents took a look at him, they
   instinctively knew that they could do better.  Born to the former Minnie Stroney on
   a day so cold that many people speculated that hell must have froze over.  His
   father, Quitja Stalin, who died two years before he was born, was cashiered from the
   Navy when a slight navigational error caused him to sail his destroyer into downtown
   Milwaukee.
</p>
<p>As you can see fate has not dealt Dakkar a kind hand.  To this day photos of him
   are still used as a birth control devices in impoverished third world systems.
</p>
<p>AGE 10 -- Vinnie, his is pet gerbil dies and is flushed to a higher spiritual plane.
   This leaves him emotionally scarred as he was quite fond of Vinnie nesting in his
   shorts.</p>
<p>AGE 12 -- He tries his hand at sex and is very pleased with himself.  His
   supersaturated loins make him the laughing stock at school.
</p>
<p>AGE 13 -- Just as his mother predicted, he starts to go blind.  His new glasses are
   so thick that they could set ants on fire, without benefit of the sun.
</p>
<p>AGE 15 -- He tries to get his first job.  Imagine his dismay when he learns that 
at every fast food restaurant, the position of talking clown has already been filled.
</p>
<p>AGE 16 -- He gets a job as a professional coin return checker, but is fired for
   spending too much time out-of-body.
</p>
<p>AGE 17 -- Dakkar runs away from home.  He has been living in an abusive
   environment, but all of it has been self-inflicted.</p>
<p>AGE 22 -- Being free of the burdens of intelligence, he enrolls in Starfleet
   Academy, after his 89 IQ is mistakenly recorded as 189.
</p>
<p>AGE 24 -- As an inventor his ideas goes unrewarded.  They include the steam-powered
   toaster, carbonated nasal spray and the wooden chimney.
</p>
<p>AGE 26 -- Dakkar acquires his first girlfriend, Taiwan Ahn, in a raffle.  Second
   prize was a warm yogurt enema.  He falls physically in love with her despite the
   nickname of &#39;<q class="nickname">Slutmuffin</q>&#39; that previous boyfriends had given her.
   She quickly tires of his frequent sticky seminal salutations and leaves him.  He tries
   to send her stuff back to her but he doesn&#39;t know what coven she belongs to.
</p>
<p>AGE 27 -- Conceit takes its toll.  His classmates say that his arrogance proceeds
   him around a corner.  They dress him up like a piñata and a group of small Mexican
   children beat him half to death.  They stop only when he began spewing something
   other than candy.
</p>
<p>AGE 28 -- When his classmates find out that he cheated on his urine test, even
   after studying, they administer the ancient Chinese remedy of acupuncture, with a
   nail gun.  Teachers claim that he has all the personality of a colostomy bag.
</p>
<p>AGE 29 -- The treachery begins.  First he is caught polluting the environment by
   selling nude pictures of Admiral Niagara (which are best not seen by minors or those
   prone to cardiac arrest.)  Then the yellow streak shows up.  At the Starfleet
   graduation ceremony at the Academy his fellow cadets consider having him castrated.
   But they soon realize that that would only be gelding the lily.
</p>
<p>AGE 30 -- When he surrenders his first ship at his first battle, his cowardice
   spawns a whole new meaning to the word &#39;<q>capitulate.</q>&#39;  He becomes the only
   commander to lose a battle in the Pug Wars.
</p>
<p>AGE 31 -- Dakkar &#39;<q>The Lizard</q>&#39; Stalin in temporarily excluded from all Planets
   of Pleasure Corp. (POPCO) houses after he attends high-heel and handcuff night
   dressed only in, high heels and handcuffs.
</p>
<p>AGE 32 -- Hard times befall Admiral Stalin.  He is suspended pending the outcome of
   psychiatric exam.  It is during this time that he is sighted at several exit ramps
   across the universe holding a sign that reads, &#34;<q>Will Betray Galaxy for Food.</q>&#34;
   The results of his exam are so upsetting that every doctor on the review team took
   their own lives.  The results were to have been published, but were not due to the
   morbidity and mortality involved.  Stalin is reinstated for lack of evidence.
</p>
<p>From this point records seem to have disappeared or have been altered.  One can
   only speculate as to their whereabouts or condition.
