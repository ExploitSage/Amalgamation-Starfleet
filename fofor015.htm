<h3>ASK DR. FORTRAN</h3>
<h4>by Dr. Pascal Fortran</h4>
<p class="letter24tran">
Dear Dr. Fortran,
</p><p class="letter24tran">
Judging by the picture in your advice column, you appear to be a sleazy scumbag with
   your finger up your nose sporting a tacky looking 1940&#39;s mustache.  You have
   bags under your eyes, your clothes look like you sleep in them, you have warts on
   your face with coarse hog hairs sprouting from them, fleas couldn&#39;t nest in your
   hair, and I&#39;ll bet your breath stinks and that you break wind in the bathtub and
   bite at the bubbles (when and if you bathe), and you probably voted for Clinton.
   You&#39;re a miserable and pathetic excuse for a human being and an insult to the
   medical profession, and it&#39;s pretty much common knowledge that you have a thing
   on your weenie.
</p><p class="letter24tran">
My question is, how did the thing get there and what do you plan to do about it?
</p><p class="letter24tran">
Disgusted
</p>
<p>Mom, how many times have I told you never to write me here!  And which one of the
   attendants let you have a pen!  I thought they were still considered a sharp
   implement!  I will say that this letter is much more legible that the ones you
   usually write with crayons.
</p>
<p>In reference to your blasphemous accusations above, I categorically deny all (well
   most, uh, make that some, okay, make that a few) of them and how dare you insinuate
   that I voted for Clinton.
</p>
<p>Also, I will have you know that not one of the 151 charges filed this year against
   me by the AMA has ever been proven.
</p>
<p>Not that it is any of your business, but that thing you refer to is a callous that
   I received as a result of a Self-Awareness and Actualization seminar I attended and
   should go away given enough rest and recuperation.
</p>
<p>Oh, just in case you&#39;re interested, the person who drew that caricature took
   one too many liberties and as a consequence has had their artistic license revoked
   along with a few fingers on their right hand.
</p>
<p>Besides, I thought you were pleased with how I looked.  People always say I&#39;m
   the spittin&#39; image of you.
