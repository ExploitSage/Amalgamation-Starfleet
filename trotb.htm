<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>The Son Broadcasting System once again takes pride in presenting the
    <span class="organization">Not Yet Ready for Cocktail Time Players</span>,
    a wholly owned subsidiary of the <span class="organization">Frontal Lobotomy
    Jazz Ensemble</span>, in yet another not-so original radio play written by
    the University of New Orleans Science Fiction and Fantasy Club.  The part of
    Tonto is closed captioned for the hearing impaired.  No funding whatever was 
    provided by the Mobil Corporation and/or your local
    <acronym title="Public Broadcasting System">PBS</acronym> station.
    <br />&nbsp;<br />
    Well, ladies and gents, last year at this time, this noble group of
    actors introduced the crew of the
    <span class="organization">Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms</span>
    Starship <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>.  We showed the crew doing
    battle with the not-so-evil Doctor Who at DarathaCon &#39;86.  In the end we
    killed off first mate Mr. Spot.  For those of you who weren&#39;t there, this
    is what you missed:
</dd>
<dt>Olhora:</dt>
<dd>Oh Lawsey, Mr. Spot be daid!  Oh, Buckwheat!  Oh, Creama Wheat!
    Oh, Farina!  Aunt Jemima!

<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd><span class="publication">The Return of the <span
    class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span></span>, the middle story of the middle
    trilogy of trilogies, which dares to chronicle the flight of the Rabble
    Alliance to free galactic control from evil yucky people, and to restore
    truth, justice, and the freedom to fly you starship anywhere you want without
    having to worry about coming out of hyperspace into the asteroid remains of the
    home planet of a beautiful princess.<br /> So far in our story, Scoot Seersucker,
    our hero, has been trained by Obi-Ben Cartwright, the second to last Mounti
    Knight, and by Yogurt, the little green guy with pointy ears who is the
    Mounti Master.  Scoot now knows the ways of the Horse. (whinny)  With a new hope
    after an initial victory, the alliance is devastated as the empire strickes back.
    But, under the direction of leader Princess Delaya Orgasma, the Rabble have
    regrouped and are ready to fight.  However, Delaya must first rescue the heroic
    Khan Solo, who has been freeze-dried by the insidious Dr. Folger, sold to Slobba
    the Mutt, vacuum-packed and put in a hermetically sealed mayonnaise jar kept on
    Funk and Wagnall&#39;s porch since noon today.<br />
    With her robot servants, U2Me2 and CU2Later, Delaya sets out for Polypropylene,
    home planet of Scoot, and kitchen base of Slobba the Mutt, where she has
    miraculously reconstituted Khan Solo, who was being kept in the mysterious
    <em>Last Cabinet on the Left</em>. (Gasp)<br />
    But, as fate would have it, Slobba the Mutt stumbled on to the rescue and
    bound the rascally rabbles over to be used as part of his insidious <em>Plan
    Nine</em>: to voyage to see what is on the bottom of an Arakeen sandworm.
    And, as in all good adventure stories (and this one, too), our hero, Scoot
    Seersucker, comes to the rescue.  He has hijacked the Polypropylene Choo Choo,
    and is presently driving it through Slobba&#39;s kennel.  We pick up our story
    as Scoot says:
</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>(Train whistle, air brakes)
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>Delaya!  Khan!  Never fear!  &#39;Tis I, Scoot Seersucker, last of the Mounti
    Knights, with the rich Leather Corinthian, who have come to save you!
</dd>
<dt>Leather:</dt>
<dd>All Aboard!
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>Khan!  Who&#39;s coming?
</dd>
<dt>Khan:</dt>
<dd>All of us, U2Me2, and CU2Later!
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>Why, where are you going?
</dd>
<dt>Khan:</dt>
<dd>No, schweetheart.  I&#39;m caling those to tin-pated soldiers with delusions
    of godhood.
</dd>
<dt>Leather:</dt>
<dd>Heah.  Ya&#39;ll grab these blazers an&#39; try to defend this train, whilst and
    at the same time, I and Scoots &#39;ll try to get this thing goin&#39; again.
</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>(Begin sounds of blazer and gun fight.  They last until the train leaves.)
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>But, how are we ever going to escape his evil paws?  Hurry, Scoot!
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>I&#39;m trying, Delaya, I&#39;m trying.  I can&#39;t seem to find the starty
    thing.  Who do you think I am, James Doohan?
</dd>
<dt>Obi-Ben:</dt>
<dd>Use the Horse, the Horse, Scoot.
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>Scoot, try this..oh..no..no, <strong>this!!</strong>
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>On Smedley!!
</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>(Whinny, hoofbeats, sound of train leaving.  Blazer fight becomes sporadic
    and ceases.)
</dd>
<dt>Leather</dt>
<dd>Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin&#39;.  (woo woo!) Polypropylene,
    here you are.   Next stop, the <span class="shipname">ALUMINIUM LEMMING</span>!
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>Meanwhile, as our heroes head to the Rabble base on board the <span
    class="shipname">ALUMINIUM LEMMING</span>, the yucky Derth Nader is informing
    the evil emperor of his plans to defeat the Rabble Alliance
    <strong>when</strong>...
</dd>
<dt>Derth:</dt>
<dd>Sire, I have a fool-proof plan for those plan-proof fools.  I&#39;ve tricked them
    into believing that the base is not complete.  They will try to attack it after
    they destroy the force field on the planet below.
</dd>
<dt>Emperor:</dt>
<dd>How can they possibly think it&#39;s unfinished?
</dd>
<dt>Derth:</dt>
<dd>I have cleverly dispersed inipid orange &#34;<q>Under Construction</q>&#34; signs all over
    this sector.
</dd>
<dt>Emperor:</dt>
<dd>We must get Seersucker.  He will ride the Dark Horse, or di-i-ie!
</dd>
<dt>Derth:</dt>
<dd>He knows who I am.  He will come to me.  It&#39;s Father&#39;s Day.  By the way,
    here&#39;s your tie.
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>Meanwhile, it&#39;s Father&#39;s Day all over the Galaxy.  Princess Delaya cannot
    figure out why her father, King Siza Orgasma, has returned the tie she gave him.
    The Rabbles are preparing their attack, <strong>when</strong>...
</dd>
<dt>Khan:</dt>
<dd>I, Khan Solo, along with Scoot, Delaya, and the &#39;Bots, will go to the
    apparently safe environs of the planet of Outdoor, where Scoot will use the
    Horse to tear down the force field generator.  Leather Corinthian, on the other
    hand, will be glad to lead the suicidal attack to blow up the Derth Star.
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>Sounds great to me Khan!  Delaya, are you coming?
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>Not yet, Scoot, not yet!
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>At last, our heroes, the Rabble Alliance, prepare for their inane, suicidal, 
    senseless, and totally stupid and futile attack on the Derth Star, further
    complicated by the proliferation of insipid orange signs dispersed through space
    like electrons in a cloud.<br />
    Meanwhile, back at the Pnderosa, Hoss and Little Joe are out back mending fences,
    and Obi-Ben is in the barn feeding Alpo to his seven year old horse (that&#39;s
    forty-nine to you and me).  And we find Scoot, Delaya, Khan, and the &#39;bots
    U2Me2 and CU2Later..
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>Why, where are you going, Mr. Announcer?
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>Nowhere, sweetheart... on the surface of the planet Outdoor,
    <strong>when</strong>...
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>Khan, why did you have to bring Terbacca the Rookie on ths mission?
</dd>
<dt>Khan</dt>
<dd>I don&#39;t know.  He&#39;s griping something about having to bring his
    grandfather a tie, and you know how a Rookie is when he doesn&#39;t get his way.
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>I don&#39;t know, I think he&#39;s kinda cute.  Sorta reminds me of these cute
    little cuddly creatures wearing women&#39;s army uniforms with practical pumps,
    who have surrounded us and are holding separs at our throats.
</dd>
<dt>Khan:</dt>
<dd>I have a funny feeling about this.
</dd>
<dt>U2Me2:</dt>
<dd>Beep bop bork glitch @*?**@@)(?!!
</dd>
<dt>CU2Later:</dt>
<dd>I agree with you completely, U2.   He-e-e-e-llppppp!!!
</dd>
<dt>Chewie:</dt>
<dd>Rooowwwwrrr!
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>What did Chewie say?
</dd>
<dt>Khan:</dt>
<dd>Somethin&#39; about &#34;<q>Don&#39;t shoot, Aunt Muriel.  It&#39;s me, Chewie
    Terbacca, your long lost nephew.</q>&#34;
</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>(Sound of cheering AWACs)
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt> 
<dd>Well, ladies and gents, it seems our insipid band of incompetent heroes have
    somehow bumbled their way into finding the only intelligent life on the planet
    Outdoor, the notorious Panatella clan of AWACs, which just so happen to be the
    long lost kin of Khan Solo&#39;s chief mate, chamois, and pet, Terbacca the
    Rookie.
</dd>
<dt>Beaver:</dt> 
<dd>Mr. Wizard, isn&#39;t Terbacca kinda tall to be related to the AWACs?
</dd>
<dt>Mr. Wizard:</dt>
<dd>Well, Beave, it is true that AWACs, or Rookies to you and me, are born with an 
    average height of three point one four one five nine two six meters tall.  But,
    since their home planet, Outdoor, is a tropical rain forest, it has the normal
    effect of constantly pouring scalding water on carpeting.
</dd>
<dt>Beaver:</dt> 
<dd>Oh!  That&#39;s easy as pie. They shrink with age until they become cute little
    cuddly creatures wearing women&#39;s army uniforms with...
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt> 
<dd>And now that Beaver Cleaver has successfully deduced the reasons for the booming
    slave trade between the planet Outdoor and the Mattel system, we can now return
    you to our insipid band of reckless rabble, who are in the village of Lucky
    Strike, which is illuminated this evening by Kool Salem Lights in celebration
    honoring the town fathers, King Edward and Prince Albert, who just happen to be
    Terbacca&#39;s Grandfather and father, respectively.  Terbacca has presented
    them with their official Galactic Father&#39;s Day ties, and has convinced them
    also that the insipid band are friends, not enemies.  This frees Scoot to follow
    his mission, which is to meet and battle his father, the yucky Derth Nader, for
    control of the galaxy, and to give him a tie.
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>But Gee, Mr. Announcer, you&#39;ve told the whole story.  There&#39;s nothing
    left for us to say.
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>Yes, Ladies and Gentlemen, Delaya has surprisingly and correctly deduce that
    <strong>I</strong> am the star of this show.  But, will she be surprised
    <strong>when</strong>...
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>Delaya, come here.  I have something to tell you.
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>Yes?  I&#39;m coming.   Hold your Horse.  What is it now?
</dd>
<dt>Scoot</dt>
<dd>I must get to the Derth Star to do battle with the yucky Derth Nader.  I must
    defeat our father.
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>Scoot, does this mean?
</dd>
<dt>Scoot</dt>
<dd>Yes, it does!
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>But Scoot!..
</dd>
<dt>Scoot</dt>
<dd>Delaya, we are identical twins!!
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>But Scoot, that&#39;s impossible.  You&#39;re a boy and I&#39;m a..
</dd>
<dt>Scoot</dt>
<dd>You underestimate the power of the Horse.
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>Scoot, do you realize that?...
</dd>
<dt>Scoot</dt>
<dd>Yes, you&#39;ll have to marry Khan Solo now.  I realize that this may be a death
    worse than fate, but it is a far better thing you do than I have ever done
    before.  Remember, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>Or the one?
</dd>
<dt>Scoot</dt>
<dd>Yes.
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>As our heroes absent-mindedly babble lines carefully plagiarized from every
    movie of the last 20 years, we look down on Dodge City and find Festus looking
    for Matt Dillon, who happens to be engaged in an illegal card game in which Miss
    Kitty is the prize.  But, since this has no relevance whatsoever to our storyline
    so far, we find ourselves aboard the <span class="shipname">ALUMINIUM
    LEMMING</span>, the command ship of the rag tag fugitive fleet of offensive
    Rabble ships trying to make their way through the proliferation of insipid
    orange signs dispersed through space like electrons in a cloud,
    <strong>when</strong>...
</dd>
<dt>Tonto:</dt>
<dd>Excuse me, Kemosabi Corinthian, Sir.
</dd>
<dt>Leather:</dt>
<dd>Well, Tonto, what can I do for you now?
</dd>
<dt>Tonto:</dt>
<dd>Tonto have ear on subspace radio.  Learn Scoot Seersucker captured by yucky
    Derth Nader and is on Derth Star.  Now Khan Solo says can&#39;t blow up
    cumbersome shield generator, since Bozo Seersucker took all explosives with him.
    Now we never find way thorugh proliferation of insipid orange signs dispersed
    through space like electrons in cloud.
</dd>
<dt>Leather:</dt>
<dd>Is that all you have to tell me, bad news?
</dd>
<dt>Tonto:</dt>
<dd>Am also receiving funny message on radio.
</dd>
<dt>Leather:</dt>
<dd>Well, Tonto, switch to tactical and put it on the monitor.

<dd>Holy Mackerel, Andy!! I&#39;ts the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>!
    We&#39;re saved!!

<dt>Tonto:</dt>
<dd>Kemosabi, what is booby prize?
</dd>
<dt>Leather:</dt>
<dd>That&#39;s what you get for coming in last place in a costume contest.
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>What&#39;s this?  Do you know what the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>
    is doing in a <span class="publication">Star Wars</span> parody?  Let&#39;s go
    to the Derth Star and see if we can find some answers.
</dd>
<dt>Derth:</dt>
<dd>Ah, I see Obi-Ben has taught you well.  I see also that you have constructed
    your own Lite Saber.
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>Yes, Dad, It&#39;s less filling, with a third less calories than your regular
    saber.
</dd>
<dt>Derth:</dt>
<dd>My son, you must ride the Dark Horse with me, whilst and at the same time ruling
    the galaxy and tap-dancing in a vat of three week old oatmeal.
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>Father, I must&#39;nt!  Not for anything!
</dd>
<dt>Derth:</dt>
<dd>Then, you shall die.
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>Well...Maybe if you make it Trix...
</dd>
<dt>Derth:</dt>
<dd>No, my rascally Rabble.  Trix are for kids.
</dd>
<dt>Emperor:</dt>
<dd>EEEE-IIIIIII-EEEEE!!!!!!!!
</dd>
<dt>Derth:</dt>
<dd>I wonder why the Emperor just commited suicide?
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>Well, either it was that last joke, or...Look!  Out There!
</dd>
<dt>Derth:</dt>
<dd>Where?
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>Out there!  That-a-way!  (Strikes Nader with Lite Saber)  Aha!  Got you!
    Gee Willikers!  It&#39;s the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>!  I&#39;m
    saved!
</dd>
<dt>Derth:</dt>
<dd>(Gasp, cough, wheeze) What&#39;s a booby prize?
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>Why, father, that&#39;s what you get for coming in last place in a costume
    contest.
</dd>
<dt>Derth:</dt>
<dd>(Tubercular wheeze) Scoot, look upon the face of your father, Polyester
    Seersucker.  And get your foot off my throat.  (slightly less wheezing)  My son,
    it&#39;s a far, far better thing you do than I have ever done.  It&#39;s a far
    better rest that I go to than I have ever known.  Obi-Ben really keeps a nice
    heaven.  Besides, I can always visit you in the sequels, and the residuals are
    great.  (Gasp!)
</dd>
<dt>Scoot:</dt>
<dd>Good!  He&#39;s Dead!  Now to get out of  &mdash;Oops!  I almost forgot!  Here&#39;s
    your tie, Dad!  &mdash; On, Smedley!!
</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>(Whinny, clopping of hooves)
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>Well, ladies and gentlemen, the yucky Derth Nader has finally bought the big one.
    That&#39;s right, he&#39;s kicked the bucket, he&#39;s pushing up daisies,
    danced his last dance, bought the farm, in ohter words, he croaked. <br />
    Meanwhile, Scoot has escaped the planet Outdoor with hopes that someone with 
    guts will blow up the Derth Star.  Meanwhile, back on the planet Outdoor, we
    find Delaya and Khan fooling around <strong>when</strong>...
</dd>
<dt>Khan:</dt>
<dd>Delaya, I think I spotted a leopard!
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>Don&#39;t be silly, Khannykins.  The come that way!
</dd>
<dt>Khan:</dt>
<dd>Oh, I tell ya, I don&#39;t get no respect.  No respect at all.  Not even from
    Delaya.  Why, last night I asked an AWAC where to find some action on a jungle
    planet, and he sent me to Delaya&#39;s hut.  Oh, I tell ya, it&#39;s rough.
    A rough planet.  Really rough.
</dd>
<dt>Cast:</dt>
<dd><strong>How rough is it??</strong>
</dd>
<dt>Khan:</dt>
<dd>Why, just last night, I show an elephant in my pajamas.  How he got in my
    pajamas, I&#39;ll never know.  But anyway, we went to get the...
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>It&#39;s a plan...It&#39;s a bird...Up in the Sky...Look, Khan!
</dd>
<dt>Khan:</dt>
<dd>It&#39;s the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>!  We&#39;re saved!
</dd>
<dt>Chewie:</dt>
<dd>OO-AArGH!!
</dd>
<dt>Khan:</dt>
<dd>What&#39;s the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>?  I don&#39;t know,
    Chewie.  CU2Later...
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>Why, where are you going?
</dd>
<dt>Khan:</dt>
<dd>Nowhere, stupid.  Hey!  You tin-pated soldier with delusions of godhood...
    what&#39;s the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>?  
</dd>
<dt>CU2Later:</dt>
<dd>Sire, the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span> is an Edsel Class heavy
    cruiser type starship designed by the most revered Hiawatha L. Niagara, Admiral
    of the <span class="organization">Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms
    Starfleet</span> (that&#39;s ANALS to you and me).  She is best known as the
    only starship to ever single-handedly defeat an entire starfleet squadron, even
    though it was her own squadron she displaced into the ether.  She comes from
    just tomorrow, in a galaxy a bit too close to home.
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>Well, now we know what the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span> is, but we
    still have no idea what in the galaxy it&#39;s doing in this radio play.
    Meanwhile, we join our regularly scheduled program already in progress aboard
    the <span class="shipname">ALUMINIUM LEMMING</span> where Tonto asks:
</dd>
<dt>Tonto:</dt>
<dd>Now Tonto know what <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span> is.  What is doing
    here, is question unanswered.
</dd>
<dt>Leather:</dt>
<dd>Well, Tonto, now that you ask, it is my duty to you and the audience to
    elaborate upon this most sanctimonious subject.  You see, folks, the chief
    engineer on the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span> is Commander Montgomery
    Ward Scotch, an old drinkin&#39; buddy o&#39; mine, and the inventor of the
    always deadly, but sometimes silent, Pharton Torpedo, which is capabable of
    destroying any material within a hundred kilometer radius surrounding the
    epicenter.
</dd>
<dt>Tonto:</dt>
<dd>But, General Kemosabi Corinthian, this epic has no center, much less beginning
    or end.
</dd>
<dt>Leather:</dt>
<dd>Tonto, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of these here
    events.  Instruct our rag-tag fugitive fleet of offensive rabble to perform the
    Ward Bond maneuver.
</dd>
<dt>Tonto:</dt>
<dd>Pardon, Kemosabi?
</dd>
<dt>Leather:</dt>
<dd>Tell &#39;em to form a circle and get the hell out of here!
</dd>
<dt>Tonto:</dt>
<dd>Ae, Aye, Kemosabi.
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>Well, folks, now we <em>think</em> we know what purpose the <span
    class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span> will serve in this program.  But:  Why is
    she here?  What insane mission could have brought such an infamous starship to
    the aid of the insipid Rabble Alliance?  And, more important, how will all this
    information affect the sex lives of rabid Irish cattle?  We&#39;ll have all
    these answers, sports, and weather coming up next aboard the Starship
    <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Delaya:</dt>
<dd>But gee, Mr. Announcer, that&#39; means we&#39;ve been written completely out
    of the script!
</dd>
<dt>Announcer:</dt>
<dd>Yes, Ladies and Gentlemen, Delaya has once again surprisingly and correctly
    deduced that she and the rest of the Rabble Alliance have been used like pawns in
    a chess gamein order for the writers to join together the first and last stories
    in the middle trilogy of trilogies, to create life out of old television
    programs, and to revive interest in something that should have died here, last
    year.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Captain&#39;s log, stardate eighty six ninety nine point nil zip naught.  We are
    apparently in orbit around a presently uncompleted small moon just north of the
    planet of Outdoor.  My information leads me to believe that Mr. Spot may still
    be alive and aboard the Derth Star ahead.  However, our approach is being
    impeded by a proliferation of insipid orange signs dispersed through space like
    electrons in a cloud.  We would have arrived here sooner, and saved the audience
    from the preceding tripe, had we not stopped on the planet of Harlem to receive
    our new science officer, Ensign T.
</dd>
<dt>T:</dt>
<dd>I pity the fool, pity the fool what touch my shiny new console!
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Zulu, are all weapons ready?
</dd>
<dt>Zulu:</dt>
<dd>Yes, Captain Quirk.
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Dammit, Jim.  Spot is dead.  You heard him drown last year while stuck to the
    terlit seat.  You yourself flushed him into space on the last program.
    Isn&#39;t it enough that you&#39;ve got the <span
    class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>?  We can go anywhere we want, even where
    no man has gone before.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>He tasks me, Bones.  He tasks me, and I shall have him.
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Jim, all you&#39;re worried about is one schmuck science officer turned cosmic
    Elf-sicle.  We&#39;re talkin&#39; Universal Armageddon!!  The pharton torpedo
    has totally random explosive power.  If Scotch rolls another six, we&#39;ll
    wipe out half the damn galaxy and ourselves along with it!  This could be worse
    than when your predecessor, Captain Crystalline Spike, rolled a six with a
    Corbomite bomb and displaced his entire squadron into the ether!  Do you have
    any idea what the chances of rolling a six are?
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Ensign T?
</dd>
<dt>T:</dt>
<dd>It&#39;s the same as rolling a one, sucker.
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>But Jim, this ship is jinxed..
</dd>
<dt>Quirk</dt>
<dd>Bones, I&#39;ll chase him &#39;round the moons of Nebir, &#39;round the Antares
    Maelstrom, and &#39;round Perdition&#39;s Flame before I give him up for dead!!
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>But Jim, that isn&#39;t orange Charmin we&#39;ve been following out here.
    It&#39;s &#34;<q>Under Construction</q>&#34; signs!
</dd>
<dt>Zulu:</dt>
<dd>Admiral, we are now in range, having passed throuh the proliferation of 
    insipid orange signs dispersed through space like electrons in a cloud. 
</dd>
<dt>Quirk</dt>
<dd>Bones, are you with me?
</dd>
<dt>Bones:</dt>
<dd>Yeah, why not?  The least we can do is to help out that insipid band
    of rascally rabbles as they attempt to free galactic control from the hands
    of evil yucky people, and to restore truth, justice, and the freedom to fly
    you starship anywhere you want without having to worry about coming out of
    hyperspace into the asteroid remains of the home planet of a beautiful princess.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Did someone say beautiful princess?
</dd>
<dt>T:</dt>
<dd>Admiral, her name be Delaya Orgasma, sucker.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Delaya..Orgasma..Oh, well.  (pregnant pause)  Never mind.  Scotchy, roll. 
    (pause) Damn!  a six!  Instant Tea, er..Ensign T, do you know what this means?
</dd>
<dt>T:</dt>
<dd>Yeah.  We gonna hafta watch reruns of Roy Rogers and dat fool Gabby Hayes
    fo&#39; t&#39;ree weeks straight.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>No, you fool!  It means to prepare this ship for damage.  Scotchy...
</dd>
<dt>Scotch:</dt>
<dd>Ach, Cap&#39;n.  Go ahead.  Jim, you always manage to tear the old girl apart,
    limb from limb, bold from nut, washer from dryer, dilithium crystal from..
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>(sharply) Bones, sedate that man.
</dd>
<dt>Maloy:</dt>
<dd>Okay, Jim.  I hate to tell you I told you so, but...
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Go ahead, Bones. Say it.  Make my day.  Zulu, fire pharton torpedoes,
    Lt. Savage, count down time to impact.
</dd>
<dt>Zulu:</dt>
<dd>Parton torpedoes Awaaaay!
</dd>
<dt>Savage:</dt>
<dd>Time to impact..four seconds..three..two..one..impact.
</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>(phart, explosion, klaxon)
</dd>
<dt>Ship:</dt>
<dd>Warning!  Near total destruction of starship! (repeat)
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Olhora, turn off that damn noise.
</dd>
<dt>Olhora:</dt>
<dd>Cap&#39;n!  I can&#39;t stop it, I can&#39;t stop it!  I don&#39;t know
    nothin&#39; &#39;bout shuttin&#39; off no alarm.. ..and I <strong>don&#39;t do
    windows!!</strong>
</dd>
<dt>T:</dt>
<dd>Here, hnoey, I&#39;ll show you how to do dat.  (Rips fire switch from the wall.) 
    (Looks down.)  My chains!  My chains!  My chains be gone!  (Leaps out through 
    pharton-induced moon roof inot deep space.)
</dd>
<dt>Maloy:</dt>
<dd>Okay, Jim.  <strong>NOW</strong> you&#39;ve done it.  You&#39;ve blown that
    apparently uncompleted small moon to kingdom come, and this god-forsaken ship
    along with it.  All we&#39;ve got left is compost power and your damned chair
    with tribble fur under the cushion.  All the rest of the crew is holding on to
    the open beams!
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Dammit, Bones!  Who told you to give the status report?  You&#39;re a doctor
    not a science officer!   What makes you think you can survey the entire ship??
</dd>
<dt>Maloy:</dt>
<dd>Well, you killed off Spot, Ensign T is off chasing his gold chains into the next
    quadrant, you made me put Scotch under, and Lt. &#39;<q>Lungs</q>&#39; Savage is inflating
    the emergency shuttlecraft.  Who the hell is left?  And what do you mean
    <strong>survey</strong> the ship?  I can see <strong>through</strong> the ship!
    There&#39;s nothing left to survey!
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Wa-a-ait a minute.  <strong>I</strong> killed off Spot?  That was you, and
    Scotchy...
</dd>
<dt>Maloy:</dt>
<dd>Okay, Jim.  I&#39;ll give you that one.  Again.  But..
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>(sedateley) My god, Bones.  What have I done?
</dd>
<dt>Maloy:</dt>
<dd>What you always do.  Wat you had to do.  Snatched defeat from the jaws of
    victory.  Turned a fighting chance for survival into complete and utter
    destruction of everything you&#39;ve known and loved.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Scotchy, what can we do?  What can we do?
</dd>
<dt>Scotch:</dt>
<dd>(Thinks, then slightly slurred (even for him)) We can rebuild her.  We have the
     technology.  We can make her better than she was.  Better, Stronger, Faster.
     And if me grandmother had a tail, it&#39;d be a waggin&#39;.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>What do you think, Bones?
</dd>
<dt>Maloy:</dt>
<dd>Jim, Scotchy&#39;s right.  Intoxicated, but right.  We&#39;ve got to fix this
    tub.  Now, we could fix her by conventional methods, but that could take years,
    and cost tens of dollars.  <strong>NO!!</strong>  In this case, we have to go
    all out.  This situation absolutely requires a really futile, stupid gesture
    on somebody&#39;s part.  And parts is parts.
</dd>
<dt>Scotch:</dt>
<dd>And I know just the guys to do it.  Dr. Maloy, do you and Capt Zulu remember
    those three stooges we met last shore leave?
</dd>
<dt>Maloy:</dt>
<dd>Yeah, I remember.  The bald-headed guy with the funny dance.  The were starship
    repairmen.  And they&#39;re not too far away.
</dd>
<dt>Scotch:</dt>
<dd>Aye. I can put a turbo-charger on the compost engine, and we&#39;ll be there in
    no time.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Okay, Scotchy.  Let&#39;s do it.  How long will it take?
</dd>
<dt>Scotch:</dt>
<dd>Well, it&#39;ll take four episodes, but as ye dinna have that much time, I&#39;ll
    do it for ya in the beginning of the next program.
</dd>
<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Okay, Scotchy.  You see to it.  Olhora, contact the Rabble Base.
</dd>
<dt>Olhora:</dt>
<dd>Honey, I been talkin&#39; to dem fools fo&#39; the las fifteen minutes now.
     Scoot Seersucker, last of the Mounti Knights, thanks you fo&#39; blowin&#39;

<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>That&#39;s all well and good, Olhora.  But did anyone see a tall green guy with
    pointy ears trailing orange toilet paper on that station?
</dd>
<dt>Olhora:</dt>
<dd>Seersucker says no tall green guy with pointy ears, but he&#39;s talkin&#39;
    with a short green guy with pointy ears and carryin&#39; a satchel o&#39;
    wargames who said &#34;<q>Live Long and Prosper</q>&#34;.

<dt>Quirk:</dt>
<dd>Damn!  Bones was right.   Olhora, tell Seersucker (pause)  &#34;<q>May the Horse be

<dd>Well, ladies and gentlemen, I guess it all makes sense now.  The star wars are
    over for now, and the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>, or what&#39;s
    left of it, is off on its mission. <br />
    But, what I really want to know is, Just who is in power in the galaxy now that
    the Emperor is dead?  Will Scoot continue to ride Smedley, the white horse?
    Will Delaya and Khan marry, have children, and populate the galaxy with little 
    rascally Mounti Knights?  Will James Tyrone Quirk find another beautiful alien
    to fall in love with before we graduate, and will they ever get the Polypropylene
    Choo Choo back on track?  The answers lie in our next episode, which we begin
    writing Monday, entitled:<br />
    <span class="publication">The Search for Spot, or I&#39;ll Take You Home Again,
    Gkathleen!!</span>
    <br />&nbsp;<br />
    <span class="publication">Return of the <span
    class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span></span> is another almost original radio
    play written and performed by <span class="organization">SOB&sup2;, the
    <acronym title="University of New Orleans">UNO</acronym> Science Fiction and
    Fantasy Club</span>.  This production is, however, a lobotomized version of the
    original not-so-original version.  For any of you who wish to know all the jokes
    you missed out on, autographed scripts may be obtained from any cast member for
    two dollars, or unlimited gratuitous sexual favors.<br />
    Tonight&#39;s production starred: <ul>
    <li>Devoid Michel,</li> <li>Goody Michel,</li> <li>Betty Eckerle,</li>
    <li><acronym title="That Creole">T.C.</acronym> Barthelemy,</li>
    <li><acronym title="Jude Jude">J.J.</acronym> Newton,</li>
    <li>Bubby Trippodo,</li> <li>and me, Bill Spicuzza.</li> </ul>
    We would like to thank Dr. Jack Stocker for keeping Herbie under glass, Peaches
    for keeping life entertaining, and <span class="organization">CoastCon</span>,
    for sending my mail to Gus&#39; house and everyone else&#39;s to mine.
