<h2>MONTHS-LONG MYSTERY CLEARED UP!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Lake Pomona, NAFeD, Earth (NIPS)</div>
<p>Staff  Fleet Admiral Dakar Keapz Stalin, who, along with the entire Fantasmagoric
   Fifth Fleet, has been missing since the marriage of Admiral Red C. Pedestrian, has
   been found and returned to the fold.
</p>
<p>Mega-Admiral Uberall S. Doitchlan reported that he made the discovery late last
   night when  he received a message from Admiral Stalin, asking to borrow three
   cents.
</p>
<p>Doitchlan, affectionately known to the galaxy as Ubi, told reporters this morning,
   &#34;<q>Stalin just took his orders too literally.  He was bugging me about why he
   wasn&#39;t invited to Red&#39;s wedding, and I told him to get lost for a little
   while.  So he did.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>The action actually helped the Starfleet High Command over come a logistical
   nightmare.  Ubi told reporters, &#34;<q>We had been trying to figure a way for all of us
   to attend the festivities surrounding the Pedestrian wedding, without the Klingfrees
   and Remoulades trying something nasty.  So when Stalin came up missing, we knew we
   had it made, &#39;cuz the enemy, those needle-nosed jars of elephant sweat,
   wouldn&#39;t dare mess around with Stalin on the loose.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Concerning the mystery of the mysterious Deduct box that brought the late Admiral
   Hiawatha Niagara temporarily back from the dead, Admiral Bloeda Groeshrees told the
   galaxy that it and its contents are safe.  &#34;<q>Stalin told me personally it is still
   intact,</q>&#34; belched Groeshrees.  &#34;<q>Stalin said that he and his fleet did make the
   humongous buy that cornered the sheep futures market, but the members of his fleet
   used their collective salaries to do so.  Stalin said that, since they didn&#39;t
   know how long they&#39;d have to be lost for, they wanted to ensure a supply line
   for a long time.  Why they had to have a thousand year&#39;s worth of sheep,
   I&#39;ll never know.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>When questioned by members of the Rhondstat as to what the Deduct Box was, and what 
   did it contain, Admiral of the Fleet Hiawatha M. Niagara said, &#34;<q>That&#39;s
   Starfleet business, and it&#39;s for us to know and you to find out!  Now butt
   out!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Starfleet information officer Admiral Ophelia d&#39;Cleavage has set a press
   conference for later in this paper to tell about the new race that Stalin and his
   fleet encountered.  Stay tuned for more details.
</p>
<h2>NEW RACE MAY BE A THREAT!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Henson Memorial Command Center, NAFed, Earth   (NIPS)</div>
<p>In a packed press conference at the Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms
   Starfleet&#39;s Jim Henson Memorial Command Center, Starfleet Information Officer
   Admiral Ophelia d&#39;Cleavage told the galaxy of the new race encountered by
   Admiral Stalin&#39;s Fifth fleet, and the details surrounding said encounter.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Here&#39;s what we know, at this time.  Admiral Stalin bumbled, I mean,
   stumbled upon a new group of people way down South, near the area where the Bjornn
   were first sighted.  Fearing they were Bjornn, he ordered his fleet into a defensive
   posture, but as soon as visual contact was made, Stalin noticed that the new ships
   were not the usual spherical shape of the Bjornn, nor did they display the erratic
   flight plan of the reclusive enemy.  Stalin then opened a dialog, during which the
   new race, who called themselves the Carsailsmians, attempted to sell Stalin, a well
   known sucker, a paper mach&eacute; mockup of the ancient NASA ship ENTERPRISE.
   Stalin began a faux negotiation, in which he, in order to lead the Carsailsmians
   along, offered to trade his flagship, A.S.S. ANDREA DORIA, all the fleets&#39;
   sheep futures and $12.43 in cash for the ENTERPRISE.  Once the deal was to go
   through, Stalin continued the ruse, looking for backup, by telling the Carsailsmians
   that he was short three cents, and would have to borrow it from a friend.  Stalin
   then opened a conference call to Mega-Admiral Doitchlan and informed him of the
   &#39;<q>deal</q>&#39;.  In the call, Ubi informed Stalin that some of the sheep shares were
   non-transferable, and that the deal could not go through, until he, Admiral
   Doitchlan, could bring in a fleet with the necessary currency to close the deal.
  The Carsailsmians then told Admiral Ubi they would have to consult with their
   Manager, and suddenly the contact was broken, and the Carsailsmians disappeared
   across the southern border.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>d&#39;Cleavage then turned the microphone over to galactic Know-It-All, Admiral
   Wilhelm Klink, who said, &#34;<q>Is this thing on?  OK, from the vids I&#39;ve seen of
   the Carsailsmians, I agree with Ubi&#39;s first impression, they are some phugly
   people!  And from what we can tell, their technology maybe on the level of the
   Klingfrees, so we better watch out!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Admiral Guhd E. Gumdrop then took over, telling the crowd, &#34;<q>We really don&#39;t
   know where they came from, so we have sent units of the 82nd Space Dogs and two
   Porneaux Class patrol ships into the Southern void to track and report on the
   Carsailsmians.  ProConsul Stocker and Admiral of the Fleet Niagara have also sent
   along the famed Downslownj negotiator Yueg Gazzongas to act as emissary for the
   Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms, if contact can be established.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>As of now, Chief of Staff Pedestrian is moving the new Sweet Sixteenth Fleet,
   under the command of Admiral Reverend Dr. Sir Frisken Search, to the region to act
   as a deterrent against any new incursions.  Admiral Search is just waiting for a
   chance to see what his new Paladin class Corpulent Gun Cruisers will do in
   action.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Admiral Klink was excited at that prospect, saying, &#34;<q>I can&#39;t wait to see
   what they think of a fully-loaded Buick torpedo being thrown in their general
   direction!  Hehehe!</q>&#34;
</p>
<h2>REPELLIUM - Fact or Fiction?
    <span class="subhead">Scientists Debate Discovery</span>
</h2>
<div class="dateline">Special to The Amalgamation, etc., from The Universe Research
   and Discovery Symposium
</div>
<p>A new substance has been discovered with known properties that are astounding.
   It has not yet been fully tested so there some as yet unknown properties.  The new
   substance has many names, but the most popular in scientific circles is Repellium,
   so named because of an unique attribute.  Any attempt to physically cut, saw,
   hammer, crush, or puncture it is repelled.  A fist-sized piece can be held in
   one&#39;s hand and it feels not quite solid.  However, if you squeeze it to measure
   elasticity or malleability, it slips from your grasp.  If dropped it falls to the
   ground at the normal rate of acceleration but stops strangely still upon landing.
   No matter the distance, it falls and stops on the ground with no sound, breakage,
   or any measurable effect upon the piece dropped or the ground itself.  If thrown
   against a wall, it stops at the wall and falls to the ground again with no sound
   or measurable effect on the wall, the piece thrown, or the ground.
</p>
<p>The largest piece found was a obtuse spheroid measuring about 6 centimeters in
   focal radius.  Many tests have been performed on it but the reasons for this unique
   characteristic remain unexplained.  It has been found that light energy applied to
   it outside the normal visual frequency or at an intensity above 12 candlepower stops
   approximately 3 millimeters from its surface.  Lasers, phazers, proton beams,
   electrical sparks, acetylene or hypertholene torches have the same effect, i.e. none.
</p>
<p>Its other effects are on sentient beings.  Telepaths cannot send or receive within
   10 meters of a piece of Repellium.  Scientists engaged in analysis of or exacting a
   smaller specimen of any given piece develop monstrous migraines that subside only
   when the activity is ceased and no plan to continue is thought about.  This has lead
   many to the theory the substance is more than a mineral and exudes some drug like
   effect.  Others believe it to be a living organism, but that theory is shunned by
   biochemists and zoologists.
</p>
<p>Dr. Eatda Groeshrees, renowned scientist and half-brother of the distinguished
   ANAL Starfleet Admiral Bloeda Groeshrees, has the most chilling theory.  &#34;<q>It is my
   belief that this is a Trojan Horse  deliberately planted to confuse the scientific
   community and waste our time when we should be researching weapons and guarding
   against espionage by known and unknown enemies of free space.  There can be no more
   plausible explanation for these facts.  All samples have been found on border
   planets.  Prolonged exposure to Repellium deactivates trash warp drives (Hey, wait
   don&#39;t print that!).</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Professor Groeshrees was escorted away by members of the Elite Eradiation Guard
   from the infamous eighth fleet. (Who heads that fleet again?)  All members of the
   press were stricken with massive headaches when inquiring about his whereabouts and
   all references to Repelium have been destroyed or erased except this o...
