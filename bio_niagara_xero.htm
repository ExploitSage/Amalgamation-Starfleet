<h1>Hiawatha L. Niagara: A Xerobiography</h1>
<div class="subtitle">Originally Published as part of the 1996
     <acronym title="New Orleans Science Fiction and Fantasy Festival">NOSF&sup3;</acronym> Program Book</div>
<p>I have known Admiral Niagara since he was a twinkle in his father&#39;s, er, creators&#39; eyes.
   We were writing up Admiral Quirk&#39;s umpteenth court martial at the hands of an as-yet-unnamed
   Starfleet high admiral for the unpardonable sin of saving the galaxy, when...
</p>
<p>Maybe I should begin at the beginning...
</p>
<p>Maybe not that far back.
</p>
<p>Ok, August 1980.  By this time, the bing bang had cooled to the point where humans could survive.
   Gene Roddenberry had created <span class="publication">Star Trek</span>, all the principals of our
   story had been born, and George and I were both freshmen at
   <acronym title="University of New Orleans">UNO</acronym>.
   (<acronym title="University of New Orleans">UNO</acronym> isn&#39;t formal enough to have froshchmen).
</p>
<p>Colleen Wallace was organizing an <acronym title="Science Fiction">SF</acronym> club at the time, and
   each of us was recruited.  I recall George telling us that he gave his nickname as
   &#39;<q class="nickname">Bill</q>&#39; to one of his professors and it stuck for a few years.  The Survivors of
   the Big Bang constitution was the first collaborative effort we both worked on, although it was a work
   of not-quite fiction.
</p>
<p>Over the next two or three years, <acronym title="Survivors of the Big Bang">SOB&sup2;</acronym> got
   to know each other, went to a few conventions, threw a few parties, played endless games of Cosmic
   Encounter, and developed a communal interest in Audio Science Fiction.  This last was especially
   unusual, because I don&#39;t recall that any individual had such an interest.  Several of us tried to
   write our own radio plays, but each of us lacked some of the skills and/or persistence to put together
   anything we were willing to show around, much less produce.
</p>
<p>Somehow, somebody got the idea to collaborate on a radio play.  We were still naive enough to think
   that we could combine our individual abilities into a gestalt.  Fortunately, we fought over what to
   write about.  Some of us wanted to do hard <acronym title="Science Fiction">SF</acronym>, some fantasy,
   some swords and sorcery, and someone had to do a mystery.  The only thing we could agree on was that
   the situation and characters had to be settled before we could begin actual writing, and that we 
   wanted to do something more serious than yet another <span class="publication">Star Trek</span> spoof.
</p>
<p>But, to misquote <acronym title="Arthur Conan">A. C.</acronym> Doyle, &#34;<q>After you have eliminated
   the impossible, all that remains, however juvenile, is to do a <span class="publication">Star Trek</span> spoof</q>&#34;.  At least ten of
   us met once or twice a week for the better part of a semester.  The first meeting, we just threw around
   character names and basic plot ideas.  Most of the ideas were direct spoofs or sequels of particular
   Trek episodes.  (This was 1982, there was only Trek Classic.)  Yet, against all odds, we created our
   own plotline for <a href="twoac.htm">The Wrath of a Con</a>.  To summarize the summary:
   The <span class="shipname"><acronym title="Amalgamation Star Ship">A.S.S.</acronym> BOOBYPRIZE</span>
   is dragged into the 20<span class="super">th</span> century by <abbr title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Who
   (Tom Baker style, the <acronym title="United States">US</acronym> hadn&#39;t seen anything else yet),
   attracted by our scrambled Orcan egg.  <abbr title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Who disguises himself as a
   fan in a <abbr title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Who costume at DarathaCon &#39;86.  We deploy the usual
   landing party, win fourth in the costume contest,
   <acronym title="Parboil Humans and Aliens by Stimulated Emission of Radiation">PHASER</acronym> a fan,
   go to a room party, find the <span class="publication">Star Fleet Battle Manual</span>, roll a six,
   fail a high energy turn (killing off a third of the crew), and return to our own time.  After that,
   &#39;<q class="nickname">Bones</q>&#39; Maloy and Montgomery Ward Scotch succeed in killing off Mr. G. Spot by
   locking him in the men&#39;s room and backing up the toilets, and his body is flushed (literally)
   into space.
</p>
<p>Somewhere along here, George dropped out of active
   <acronym title="Survivors of the Big Bang">SOB&sup2;</acronym> membership, and the Amalgamation
   faltered.  We recorded <a href="twoac.htm">The Wrath of a Con</a> at Fed Haugh&#39;s house on
   April 1, 1983, and converted it to a stage play and performed it at
   <span title="No, not VulKon; this was a local con circa 1974-1991">VulCon*</span>.  That Saturday
   night at VulCon 1983 was the same night as the last pan-galactic gargle blaster party for a decade or
   so.  Both are best remembered in the forgetting.  However, it was at about this point that George came
   back to <acronym title="Survivors of the Big Bang">SOB&sup2;</acronym>.
</p>
<p>Somehow, despite the flop at VulCon, we were asked to perform
   <a href="twoac.htm" title="The Wrath of a Con">TWOAC</a> at CoastCon the next year.  We decided to
   un-stage it, and do a live radio play (we did wear costumes, but the show was in the audio.)  It was
   in large part due to George&#39;s insistence at having numerous rehearsals at which we actually
   improved timing and emphasis that we were a hit on March 10, 1984.  (this date later became stardate
   0:0000).
</p>
<p>The only problem with success at CoastCon was that they wanted us to do another play the next year!!
   Our working title was Revenge of the Dead-Eye.  It would be a parody of the
   <span class="publication">Star Wars</span> trilogy, of which the last was released in May, 1983.
   At this point, we fully believed Lucas would continue doing these movies every three years into the
   twenty-first century.  After numerous brain-storming sessions at various bars and the physics club
   room, we set a date for the writing sessions.  It only took about four sessions to write this one,
   partially because we had the plotline fleshed out a little better in advance, but mostly because
   only George, Liz Eckerle, and I showed up for them.  Most of the play was written by George and Liz
   dialogue-ing out the parts, with me throwing in wisecracks and scribbling furiously.  Our primary
   difficulty with this play was Lucas&#39; use of establishing visuals.  We didn&#39;t want to stray
   from audio format, so the announcer&#39;s role was increased.  The net effect was that the announcer
   wound up delivering half of the plot and our timing strongly resembled the <span class="publication"
   >The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show</span>.  Also, none of the characters we had written had the guts to
   blow actually blow up the Derth Star, so we brought in the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>
   crew to do it.  The motive?  They saw the insipid orange &#34;<q>under construction</q>&#34; signs dispersed
   through space like elecrons in a cloud, and thought it was toilet paper left by the apparently 
   not-so-late Mr. Spot.  We rolled another six with a PHARTON torpedo, and blew up &#34;<q>half the 
   damn galaxy and ourselves along with it</q>&#34;.  Mr. Spot&#39;s replacement, Ensign T (as in &#34;<q>I
   pity the fool what touch my shiny new console</q>&#34;) was also lost when he leapt into space after
   his gold chains, which had been tossed out by Bones.
</p>
<p>Our main problem with performing the play was that it was too long.  CoastCon only wanted about
   twenty five minutes, and we had about forty.  We decided to jettison the opening stuff about
   sneaking everyone into Slobba the Mutt&#39;s doghouse and Delaya Orgasma dissolving the 
   dehydrated Khan Solo in warm water to reconstitute him, and give all that to the announcer,
   too.  (The opening was later restored as the Un-Lobotomized version.).  But, wouldn&#39;t you
   know it, the convention then asked us if we could do another fifteen minutes.
</p>
<p>The working title of the third play was given in <a href="trotb.htm"
   title="The Return of the BOOBYPRIZE">TROTB</a> as &#34;<q>In Search of...Spot, or I&#39;ll take you
   home again, Kathleen</q>&#34;.  We had no idea that these titles were in any way linked, until I
   thought, &#34;<q>What if Spot&#39;s first name was Kathleen?</q>&#34;  Unfortunately, he was already
   G. Spot, so it had to become &#34;<q>I&#39;ll take you home again, Gkathleen</q>&#34;.  This was a fully
   Amalgamation play, with cameos by the P-team (<abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Panadol Smith, Facemaker,
   and the return of Ensign T.) and the Starship construction/repair team of Howard, Fine, and Howard.
   To summarize:  We find Mr. Spot&#39;s Kaka (his soul) and reunite it to his body (we found it
   somewhere) in an ancient voodoo ritual involving a King Edward Cigar.  We also blow up a 
   Klingfree and a Remoulade fleet along the way.
</p>
<p>Anyway, we had done three plays at this point, and we had called the second play &#34;<q>the middle
   story of the middle trilogy of trilogies</q>&#34;.  And we had numbered our three plays 1, 2, and 3.
   (Lucas post-dated Star Wars to #4).  So, our next story, the first story of the first trilogy
   of trilogies, became Star Yecch Negative Two: Forward into the Past.  It opens with the above
   mentioned court-martial.  Niagara dismisses the charges before they are even read, but sentences
   the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span> crew to man the new <span class="shipname"
   >EXPECTORATION</span> battle cruiser, with it&#39;s ill-omened Trash
   <acronym title="Washer/Argyle Propulsion">WArP</acronym> Drive.
</p>
<p>We took on Rocky Horror in Star Yecch Negative One, which had essentially no pot, but, then,
   it was a musical. &#34;<q>It&#39;s just a sock to the left, panty hose to the right, but that jock
   on your hips, and you pull it up tight!  It&#39;s the cosmic socks that really drive you 
   through space!  Let&#39;s use the Trash <acronym title="Washer/Argyle Propulsion">WArP</acronym> 
   again!</q>&#34;  This was the last dramatic appearance of the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>
   crew, but the emphasis had already shifted to the written word and the Admiralty.
</p>
<p>During carnival 1988, Anthony&#39;s car, christened the <span class="shipname">ANDREA DORIA</span>
   (DYV-1060), was hit and run uptown, only a day or so after other collision damage had been
   repaired.  It was time to go to war against the Ubangmees.  We wrote our first newspaper ever
   (the headline was &#34;<q>War!</q>&#34; and the subtitle &#34;<q>HUUNNGH!</q>&#34;) and put it on the freebie desks
   at CoastCon.  We also pre-printed some letterhead and produced three more newsletters at
   CoastCon.  It was fin, but we missed almost the whole con.  (Of course, we were printing on
   George&#39;s Atari, at a blistering 5 <acronym title="characters per second">cps</acronym> or
   so.)  After that experience, we pre-printed all of the newspapers before the convention.
</p>
<p>Since his initial Court-Martial, Admiral Niagara has waged a dozen or so wars upon the Ubangmees,
   Bjornn (Huge tennis ball ships that bounce around space), the F&#39;Gawis, the Klingfrees, the
   Remoulades, and others.  He as also handled internal uprisings by the Obsidians, the Rhondstadt
   (<acronym title="also known as">aka</acronym> Senate), and the Rubble Alliance.  He has 
   capriciously re-assigned (nearly) everyone in Operation Coronary, been killed by at least 
   seventy-two 
   <acronym title="Parboil Humans and Aliens by Stimulated Emission of Radiation">PHASER</acronym>
   blasts (self-inflicted in a room of mirrors), been improperly succeeded by his sibling-clone
   Hiawatha M Niagara and bastard son Will E. Dicker, and now, a year later, found alive upon
   emergency exhumation of his remains.
</p>
<p>Hiawatha L. Niagara not only lives in interesting times, he leads an interesting life.  Not bad
   for a clone.
