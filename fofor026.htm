<h3>ASK DR. FORTRAN</h3>
<h4>by Dr. Pascal Fortran</h4>
<p class="letter24tran">
Dear Dr. Fortran,
</p><p class="letter24tran">
   My question is about icebergs in the southern polar region.  Though you have
   explained the northern pole phenomenon adequately insufficiently, your answer
   sadly lacks any comment about the similar, and different occurrences of icebergs
   at the southern pole.
</p><p class="letter24tran">
   We have taken it upon myself to expand on the aforementioned experiment but instead 
of a glass, we used a jar with a lid and the same four cubes.  The result proved that
   if the capped jar was inverted then the cubes floated to the bottom of the jar.  We
   also found that if the jar was not capped, then the cubes floated on the floor.  The
   results of these experiment seem to contradict the Law of Frigidynamics; since in
   our experiment all cold masses rose to the bottom.
</p><p class="letter24tran">
C ould you please explain these seemingly compatible incompatibilities?  In
   conclusion, it is our position that the north and south poles are both the top and
   the bottom of the jar.  Or they may be different factions of the same country,
   living in different magnetic areas, and are currently believed to be at civil
   (uncivil?) war.  Please see the North Poles v. South Poles document located in our
   nonexistent database.
</p><p class="letter24tran">
   Thank you for any help that you may not give us.  Our team is currently working
   feverishly on compiling the results of pataphysical experiment 0Zero0 which we hope
   will prove the source of the roots of the cubes.
</p><p class="letter24tran">
   Shivering with Excitement
</p>
<p>My God man, you rattle on, don&#39;t you?
</p>
<p>Ah, always someone who still does not grasp fully all the forces in effect
   concerning the Laws of Frigidynamics.
</p>
<p>My dear fellow in wonderment, the answer is purely simple.  Most people do not
   worry about the Southern icebergs (known in the science world as <em>chillus
   dixius</em>, as opposed to their nothern counterparts, <em>chillus damyankius</em>)
   as they tend not to make their presence known up north, and stick to themselves
   pretty much down South.
</p>
<p>This is because they are stuck on Antarctica.  This effect can also be simulated
   by pouring about 0.5 cc of cold water into a chilled glass and quickly adding the
   ice.  Wait a minute, and fill the glass with water.  Of course, the north bound pull
   will cause them to calf eventually, leading to the phenomena you describe.
</p>
<p>But, the laws do apply.  The phenomenon you are questioning was first studied in
   detail by the most revered Reverend Dr. Sir Frisken Search, late of the University
   of Lake Pomona and his sidekick, Admiral Dr. Wilhem Klink.  Their studies can be
   found in the December 1941 issue of Frigidynamics Today.
</p>
<p>However, if you do not have access to that article, follow my explanation herewith.
   Anyone who has tracked the icebergs has noticed that they do take a northern track
   towards the top of the Earth, but since they are repulsed by a little known force,
   dubbed by Thermo-scientists as Sherman effect, they tend to mosey around down South
   until they expire, thus never making the full trip to the top of the Earth.
</p>
<p>The Sherman effect was inadequately described in 1965 by Devoid Michel as a vector
   sum of coriolis, buoyancy, the northern tug, electromagnetism, refractive Kirlian
   photography, and alcoholism.  
</p>
<p>You can note that in your experiment, under artificially created environs, ice
   cubes placed at the bottom of a glass will float upwards.  In fact, try this for a
   better test.  Freeze some water in the bottom of a jar.  This will be in effect the
   creation of a <q>southern iceberg</q>.  Introduce the fluid of your choice, and you
   will notice that the <q>berg</q>  will move to the top, albeit in a more leisurely
   and typical motion of things Southern.  There you have it.
</p>
<p>I hope this will help you in your continuing studies of the world on which we live.
  Ain&#39;t science wonderful?
