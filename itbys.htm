   duty ever, next to straightening out one&#39;s sock drawer.  I, Admiral
   James Tyrone Quirk, the most infamous starship Captain in the known
   universe, and the personal enemy of the Klingfree Empire, am about ready
   to tell Starfleet to shove this patrol...</q>&#34;

<div class="dialog">
<p>&#34;<q>Capt&#39;m, Capt&#39;m!!! We&#39;re receivin&#39; a really obnoxious
   message.</q>&#34; This was Communications officer Commander Ijusta Olhora.
   &#34;<q>He be sayin&#39; &#39;<q>Beep Beep!  Get owta my way!</q>&#39;</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>At that point in time, Ensign Devider Intwain, the new navigator, somehow
   instituted an evasive right, tossing everyone who was asleep, and some who
   were not, out of bed.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Godsdammit Intwain!  Tryin&#39; to kill us?</q>&#34; bellowed Quirk.  &#34;<q>Hans,
   What do you make of her?</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Hans Oleo, expert helmsman and soon-to-be Captain, looked hard at the view
   screen.  &#34;<q>Yes, sir.  It&#39;s just your standard rice-rocket from
   Mitsubishi Sector, Uncle Ben Class, converted, Sir.  She&#39;s doin&#39;,
   oh I&#39;d say <acronym title="Washer/Argyle Propulsion">WArP</acronym> 9.
   Probably a smuggler.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Engineering!  Scotchy!  I need everything you&#39;ve got.  <acronym
   title="Washer/Argyle Propulsion">WArP</acronym> 10!</q>&#34;, announced Quirk.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>At your command!</q>&#34; replied Montgomery Ward Scotch, the universe&#39;s
   greatest engineer.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Red Alert!  Hi-ho, Oleo!  Away!</q>&#34; begged Quirk.

   slimy Nipper.
</p>
</div>

<div class="dialog">
<p>The elevator opened to the bridge, discharging First Officer Ynabed
   Ubeddumma Savage, alarmingly alarmed.  &#34;<q>Big Jim, I mean, Admiral sir,
   we shouldn&#39;t persue this so quickly.  That rice rocket is heading in
   the direction of the Calcutta!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Not <strong>the</strong> Calcutta!!</q>&#34; screamed the bridge crew.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Yes, that Calcutta!</q>&#34; returned Savage.  &#34;<q>By the way, you all did
   that nicely!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Admiral, no one has ever returned from that black hole!</q>&#34;, cried Oleo.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Hans, full reverse!  Hang a right!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>The <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span> strained at the sudden attempt
   to change direction.  Lights dimmed, decks twisted, stomachs turned, cookies
   crumbled, balls bounced.  Savage&#39;s hair was tossed like a chef&#39;s
   salad, and her insipid orange bobby pins were dispersed through space like
   electrons in a cloud.
</p>
<p>The <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>&#39;s computer did not go
   unused.
</p>
<p>The view screen grew blanker and blanker as the hole loomed closer and
   closer.  &#34;<q>Too late, Admiral!  We&#39;re goin&#39; in,</q>&#34; announced
   Savage.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Oh, lawsey, we&#39;ze gonna die!</q>&#34; yelled Olhora.  &#34;<q>Starfleet!
   Starfleet!  This is the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>!  Oh,

   Hey, Mutha trucka&#39;s!  We is gonna <strong>die</strong>!  Oh, Farina!
   Oh, Buckwheat!  Oh, Aunt Jemima!  Hi-Ho Silver!  We is goin&#39; away!</q>&#34;

<p>&#34;<q>Yes, sir, that&#39;s it.  Not so much as a peep,</q>&#34; replied Admiral

</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Good.  Maybe we&#39;re rid of them.  Send out a Porneaux Patrol Ship to the

<p>The <span class="shipname">SADDAM HUSSEIN, DYF-0199</span>, the last of the
   Edsel-Class Battlewagons, is prethently patroling the Calcutta Sthector.
   We have not theen any action since yethterday when we recovered the hulk of
   an ancient Mitthubithi rithe rocket.  The hull rath deformed entirely
   beyond recognithion by the gravitational fortheth which envelope the Calcutta
   thingamajig.  Yeth, thingamajig.  It uthed to be called a black hole, but it
   rethently had changed color to a shade of purple-gray.
</p>
<p>Our Klingfree crew hath been asthigned to thith thhip ath a way to 
   familiarithe ourthelveth with the Amalgamation thhipth.  All of thith 
   headache wath cauthed by the inthipid peathe treaty, completed a
   kilofortnight ago, betwixtht the Amalgamation of Thuper-Thuperfluouth
   Humanoidth of Limited Enterprithe and the Klingfree Empire.  We have joined
   together becauthe we are oh-tho-tired of fighting each other, and the fact
   that neither of uth have heard from the Remouladeth in fourty-five yearth
   hath bothered uth a wee bit.
</p>
<p>We had to do a little refurbishing of the ship to meet our tasthteth.
   Bruuth, my firtht and only mate, picked out thith ethereal magenta running
   hide for our chairth, and a tathteful thunthine yellow for the wallth of
   the bridge.  I found thome picthureth of a human pleathure palathe that I
   hope to model the bridge after.  This thhip ith tho crath!  It&#39;th 
   hideouth!  I love it.
</p>
<p>We haven&#39;t got the hang of thith rolling-the-die before firing Pharton
   torpedoeth, but I do like the thhade of red they uthe for battle alert.
</p>
<p>Thith patrol could be dethcribed ath the motht boring and utheleth duty
   ever, nextht to thtraightening out one&#39;th thock drawer.
   <strong>BOOORING!</strong>

<div class="dialog">
<p>&#34;<q>Amiga Krrrl!  Amiga Krrrl!  The Tappan long-range sensors are picking up
   something exiting the &#39;jig!</q>&#34; chirped Ensign Grade AA Large Mrrxs.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Quick, yellow alert!  Dscortt, what do you make of her?</q>&#34; questioned
   the Amiga.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Well, I&#39;d like to make her into a jelly roll with pylon cream
   filling, but I can&#39;t, since she really looks like one of ours!</q>&#34;
   explained <abbr title="lieutenant">Lt.</abbr> Commander Dscortt.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>It&#39;s an Edsel!</q>&#34; screamed the bridge crew!
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>That&#39;s Impossible!</q>&#34; retorted Krrrl. &#34;<q>We&#39;re the last of the
   Edsels, or so the Amalgamation would have us believe.</q>&#34;  The Amiga paused
   for a second. &#34;<q>Something&#39;s damn peculiar.  Go to Red Alert!  Full
   Battle Status!.  If they want to test us, we&#39;ll give them a test to end
   all tests.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Sounds very proctological to me, Amiga!</q>&#34; returned Science Officer
   Mffdvr, who was just entering the bridge.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Ship is now at full alert, sir!</q>&#34; reported Mrrxs.

<p>The brige grew quiet for a moment, that quiet that one hears while lying in a

<div class="dialog">
<p>Mr. Mffdvr&#39;s boot broke the silence.  &#34;<q>Ouch!</q>&#34; suffered Mffdvr.
   &#34;<q>Sorry.  Sir, I think that I&#39;m reading this right.  The ship is
   definitely an Edsel, a very old and rare Corvair configuration.  She&#39;s
   running on COM-POST power, of all things.  How uugh!  The computer is trying
   to figure out who she is.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>That can&#39;t be hard,</q>&#34; figured Dscorrt.  &#34;<q>They only built five of

</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Oh my Stars!</q>&#34; screamed Mffdvr.  &#34;<q>They are signalling us!  They want
   us to talk to them! Can you believe that?!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>What if they want us to surrender?</q>&#34; Mrrxs wondered.  &#34;<q>What will we
   do?  What <strong>will</strong> we do?</q>&#34;

<p>It was the darkness which panicked everyone.  When one is used to having
   multi-colored displays, screens that show swirls and blinking squares, and
   the view screen constantly eminating light, total darkness can scare the
   bejesus [whatever that is] out of you.  Especially, if you are James Tyrone
   Quirk, a man in his extremely late forties who still sleeps with a night
   light.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Scotchy!  Can you get us some power up here?!  Lights, candles, anything!
   Damn, something&#39;s crawling up my leg!</q>&#34; screamed Quirk.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Sorry, Admiral,</q>&#34; begged Savage.  &#34;<q>I, uh, lost my, uh, place</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Oh, that&#39;s okay.  Carry on.</q>&#34;  An orgasmic moment passed. 
   &#34;<q>Scotchy!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>In just a minute, Admiral!  We&#39;re picking up the pieces down here!</q>&#34;
   Muffled thuds, bangs, clanks, and screams accompanied Mr. Scotch&#39;s voice.
   &#34;<q>All we&#39;ve got left is the batteries, sir.  Ugnhf!  I can have
   auxilliary power as soon as I can <strong>Ouch!</strong> find the damn light
   switch.  <strong>Yikes!</strong></q>&#34;
</p>
<p>A sizzling sound ended the last transmission, but not before the lights came
   on, which was then followed on the bridge by muffled swearing, the sounds of
   zippers being pulled, and &#34;<q>thanks</q>&#34; being passed around.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>It would seem to me that Mr. Scotch found the right fuse,</q>&#34; mused the
   Admiral.
</p>
<p>A &#34;<q>ding</q>&#34; followed by a &#34;<q>swish</q>&#34; announced the fact that the elevator
   had arrived.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Goddammit Jim, what the hell&#39;s going on?!</q>&#34;  This was the
   galaxy-revered medical officer Leonhard &#39;<q>Bones</q>&#39; Maloy, ship&#39;s
   doctor and movie critic.  Also galaxy-revered drinking partner of the
   Admiral, the engineer, and two-thirds of the galaxy.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Bones, how&#39;d you get up here?  Didn&#39;t you know the lifts
   weren&#39;t working?</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Sorry, didn&#39;t have time to check the script.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Anyway, how could you see where you were...?</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Shit, haven&#39;t any of you idiots ever heard of a flashlight?</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>I have!</q>&#34; came from a few of the bridge crew.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Oh shut up.  You haven&#39;t answered my question, Jim.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>We got pulled int the black hole of Calcutta,</q>&#34; sighed Jim.  &#34;<q>As soon
   as Scotchy gets us some power, we can find out where we are.  Anyway,
   shouldn&#39;t you be in sick bay?  There&#39;s bound to be some people hurt,
   if not killed.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Well, I guess I should.  Have a nice day!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>With that, the lift sighed and whisked Dr. Maloy down and across to the 
   hospital, where there were wounded and dying awaiting him.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back on the bridge, auxilliary power had been restored, causing
   computers and instruments to commence blinking, buzzing, and chirping.
   Ensign Entwain was about to report.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Sir, it seems that we are pretty close to where we were before we went
   into the hole.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>What do you mean, &#39;<q>it seems</q>&#39;?</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Before the ensign could respond, Quirk&#39;s attention was grabbed by the
   viewscreen, which showed the usual magnificent field of different colored
   stars against the solemn black of space.  Only this time there was a white
   dot up and to the left of the center.  It was growing larger.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Hans, what the hell is that little dot?</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>I don&#39;t know, sir.  It looks like one of ours.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>We don&#39;t have any dots.  Savage, check it out.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Savage checked her computer, punching numerous buttons many times over.  The
   computer screen displayed the outline of an Edsel class Battlewagon, but
   inserted question marks next to its name and number.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>No doubt, one of ours, but which one?  Looks like the computer&#39;s
   confused.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Quirk pondered the situation for a moment, during which a deathly silence
   reigned on the bridge, if you don&#39;t count the buzzing and chirping of
   the instruments and computers.
</p>
<p>At last, Quirk spoke.  &#34;<q>Could be a rescue ship.  Olhora did yell pretty
   loud.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Thank you, hunney.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>But, I&#39;m not taking any chances.  I still remember that Con crap.  The
   computer&#39;s screwed up, and we really can&#39;t see it very well.  It
   could be a Klingfree Frog of Prey in disguise.  I heard they can do that with
   their Croaking devices.  Savage, go to Red Alert.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Savage punched some more buttons, causing lights to blink, sirens to wail,
    Olhora to yell, <acronym
    title="Parboil Humans and Aliens by Stimulated Emission of Radiation"
    >PHASER</acronym>s to charge, shields to raise, and torpedoes to arm.
    Not a bad job for just a few buttons.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Olhora, open a hailing frequency.  Let&#39;s see who they are.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>The multi-efficient commications officer bent to her task.  &#34;<q>You&#39;re
   on, Jim, baby</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>How many times have I told you not to call me...</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Sir, that is an open line,</q>&#34; reminded Savage.
</p>
<p>Quirk spoke into the air.  &#34;<q>This is the Amalgamation Starship
   <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>.  Identify your vessel.  I repeat,
   this is the Amalgamation Starship <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>.
   Identify your vessel.</q>&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="dialog">
<p>Silence once again filled the bridge, if again you don&#39;t count the
   buzzing and chirping of the instruments and computers.  Seconds dragged into
   moments, and moments into a minute.  As they watched, the other ship loomed
   ever closer to the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Why don&#39;t they answer?</q>&#34; wondered Quirk.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Maybe their Chamber&#39;s coil has overloaded?</q>&#34; pondered Oleo.  &#34;<q>That
   could be it, or maybe they&#39;re waiting to get close enough for a real
   shot.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>They&#39;re already close enough or that.  F&#39;narkie, target the
   engines, and stand by with pharton torpedoes.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Commander Achew F&#39;narkie, the best shot this side of Dodge City, 
   grinned a huge grin, and set his sights on the other ship.  &#34;<q>Ready,
   sir.  I rolled a two.</q>&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="dialog">
<p>Silence once again filled the bridge, if again you don&#39;t count the
   buzzing and chirping of the instruments and computers. Olhora finally broke
   this silence.  &#34;<q>Sorry, guys.  Musta been those beans I ate.</q>&#34; 
</p>
<p>While everyone began to hold thier breaths, a lisping voice appeared on the
   radio.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>This is the Amalgamation Starship <span class="shipname">SADDAM
    HUSSEIN</span>.  You have given the identification of a non-existent ship.
    Properly identify yourself, or I will blow you..., er..., smash your ship
    into iddy bitty bits.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>He sounds like a Kling! Olhora, get me a visual!</q>&#34; yelled Quirk.
</p>
<p>The viewscreen changed to show the interior of a ship that could best be
   described as a hideous cross between an Edsel and a really cheap New Orleans
   whorehouse.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>It is Klings!  Why, those fuzz-sucking insufferable blue-nosed
    pick-lickers have captured one of our ships!  Fire!</q>&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="dialog">
<p>Two brown spheroids screamed from the hull of the <span
   class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>, impacting nanoseconds later into the hull
   of the <span class="shipname">HUSSEIN</span>.  The result was painful to the
   eye, and much more painful to those occupying the <span
   class="shipname">HUSSEIN</span>, especially the engineering department.
</p>
<p>The <span class="shipname">HUSSEIN</span> began to tumble from the impact
   as parts of her ain drive area were dispersed through space like electrons in
   a cloud.  Quirk was pleased at the growing destruction.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Good shooting, F&#39;narkie!  Olhora, order them to surrender and prepare
   to be boarded.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Sir, they be radioin&#39; for help!  And they&#39;s askin&#39; why we
   fired on them.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Suddenly, a green <acronym
   title="Parboil Humans and Aliens by Stimulated Emission of Radiation"
   >PHASER</acronym> beam weakly streaked from the <span
   class="shipname">HUSSEIN</span> to the <span class="shipname"
   >BOOBYPRIZE</span>, and for a brief moment the two ships were connected.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>No damage, sir.  The Dalkon shields can hold that intensity!</q>&#34; cried
   Savage.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Let me finish them off, sir!</q>&#34; begged F&#39;narkie.  &#34;<q>Please?!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Quirk thought for a moment.  &#34;<q>Could there be a chance any of our people
   could still be aboard?  Olhora, patch me in.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>The scream changed once again, but this time the hideous whorehouse looked
   like it had been raided by King Kong.  Smoke drifted everywhere, torn bodies
   were visible, as was damaged equipment.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Hey, are there any humans aboard your ship?</q>&#34; asked Quirk.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Of course not.  This is an all Klingfree crew!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Quirk smiled.  &#34;<q>Thanks, that&#39;s all I wanted to know.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>He turned to F&#39;narkie and winked.  &#34;<q>Leave no trace.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Green rays from the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span> raked the
   <span class="shipname">SADDAM HUSSEIN</span>, neatly cutting pieces from the
   ship.  Hull plates collapsed and/or exploded, sparks filled space where 
   cables and tubes were cut.  An escape pod was jettisoned, but Hans Oleo,
   who had joined at the weapons console, nabbed the little bastard.  As soon
   as the torp load status showed ready, F&#39;narkie sent them flying.
</p>
<p>The main dish section ripped into billions and billions of pieces, assuring
   that hardly anyone was left alive.  The bridge crew on the <span
   class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span> cheered each explosion, until Lt.
   Savage spoke.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Sir, their engines are going to blow in about five seconds.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Quirk sat upright.  &#34;<q>Hans, get us out of here.  Scotchy, 
   <acronym title="Washer/Argyle Propulsion">WArP</acronym> drive, now!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Ayer Admiral!  Step on it!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Hi-Ho, Oleo!  Away!</q>&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="dialog">
<p>And, once again, quicker than you could say &#34;<q>Ops</q>&#34; (which is a whole lot
   quicker than &#34;<q>oops</q>&#34;), the <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>,
   <span class="organization" title="That&#39;s ANALS to you and me">The
   Amalgamation of Non-Aligned Lifeforms Starfleet</span>&#39;s most infamous
   Edsel Class Battlewagon (a little redundant, don&#39;t you think?),
   stumbled into <acronym title="Washer/Argyle Propulsion">WArP</acronym>
   speed, trekking the light fantastik in a heroic attempt to save their lives.
   (It&#39;s amazing the things you can do with your word processor.)
</p>

<div class="scene">
<div class="dialog">
<h2>Captain&#39;s Log: Stardate ...</h2>
<p>&#34;<q>Olhora, what&#39;s the stardate?</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Well, according to Starfleet, it be 10:1786.39,</q>&#34; responded the
   luscious Commander.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Wait, you got Starfleet?  I thought you told me a minute ago that you
   couldn&#39;t make out most of the radio transmissions?</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>I did say dat, but I was able to find WWV and get the correct time.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Lt. Savage butted in.  &#34;<q>Sir, either the computer is still screwed up, or
   we have jumped ahead 87 years.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Think about it, Savage,</q>&#34; returned Quirk, &#34;<q>this is the 
   <span class="shipname">BOOBYPRIZE</span>.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Oh.</q>&#34; Savage pondered a moment.  &#34;<q>Well, I guess that means the
   computer is screwed up.</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>There&#39;s no way that this tub could...  Well, it is possible. . . Nahh.</q>&#34;
   That was typical Quirk.
</p>
<p>A &#39;<q>ding</q>&#39; followed by a &#39;<q>swish</q>&#39; announced the fact that the
   elevator had arrived.
</p>
<p>&#34;<q>Dammit, Jim, you know we&#39;ve time traveled before.</q>&#34;  This was equally
   typical Dr. Maloy.  &#34;<q>Think about it.</q>&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="dialog">
<p>Silence once again filled the bridge, if again you don&#39;t count the
