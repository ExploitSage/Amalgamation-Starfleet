<h2>A.S.S. ARIZONA FIRES NEW SUPER WEAPON!</h2>
<div class="dateline">Hoelda Mayo, System, Remoulade Space (NPS)</div>
<p>The Remoulade planet Hero Sheemah ceased to exist this morning as the Amalgamation
   of Non-Aligned Lifeforms Starfleet unleashed the newest weapon of destruction, the
   Pluto Torpedo.
</p>
<p>The order to use the new weapon came from Admiral of the Fleet Hiawatha M. Niagara,
   after conferring with Amalgamation ProConsul Stocker, Starfleet Command, and many of
   the governments of the systems of the Amalgamation.
</p>
<p>The decision to use the weapon came after the rescue of Admiral Wil E. Dicker, and

   after no response to Admiral Niagara&#39;s ultimatum was received  from the
   Remoulade Government.
</p>
<p>The new weapon was fired by Captain E. Nola Gae, acting captain of the
   A.S.S. ARIZONA (DYF-0156).  The ARIZONA, the flag ship of Admiral Ittaint Muzak&#39;s
   Omnipotent Twelfth Fleet, secretly carried the weapon from Manhat An, where the
   weapon was reportedly developed by Admiral Muzak and galactic know-it-all Admiral
   Wilhelm Klink.
</p>
<p><img src="images/space1.jpg"
    alt="Explosion on a planet.  The mushroom cloud has about half the volume of the planet."
   />Admiral Rip D. Fauhtze, whose
   Invincible First Fleet along with Admiral Sir Frisken Search&#39;s Fantabulous
   Fifteenth destroyed the planets defense fleet and rescued Admiral Dicker, said of
   the attack, &#34;<q>I knew it was going to be big, but , Damn!  One second it was there,
   next second, POW, BANG, ZOOM, To the moon, Alice!</q>&#34;
</p>
<p>Niagara Intergalactic Press was able to get a statement from one of the
   co-developers of the weapon, galactic know-it-all Admiral Wilhelm Klink.  Contacted
   at his offices at the Crystalline Spike Memorial School For Wayward Pilots, the home
   of  the Disknee Company&#39;s top secret weapons development labs, Klink said,
   &#34;<q>Is this thing on?  Good  It should not have blown up the entire planet.  But, the
   Rems had stockpiled huge amounts of onions, Creole mustard, Italian dressing, and
   anchovy paste on Hero Sheemah.  When the ingredient of the bomb reacted with all
   that combustible material, the result was inevitable.  Good thing the Rems like
   anchovy paste, I say.</q>&#34;

<h2>&#34;<q>P-BOMB IS HAIR OF THE DOG</q>&#34;, SAYS SCOTCH</h2>
<div class="dateline">Westend Spacepier, Earth. (IGNN)</div>
<p>Intergalactic News Network contacted Commander Montgomery Ward Scotch, Chief
   Engineer aboard DYF-0151-A, A.S.S. BOOBYPRIZE for technical information on the new
   bomb used against the Rems.  Scotch reportedly developed the idea for the bomb the
   morning after the retirement party for the BOOBYPRIZE&#39;s former First Officer,
   Captain G. Spot.  The Following is his testimony.
</p>
<p>The Pluto bomb is the short name for the Pluto-kneeum bomb which is made entirely
   from 151% pure doggie breath.  The hapless recipients are stifled to death by the
   stench which is preceded with considerable choking and gagging.  It inhibits mental
   and physical capacities to a point less than zero.  Those few sick puppies who
   survive are left just plain goofy.
</p>
<p>It is made from a compound called K9-238 that is created when dogs lick their
   balls.  It has a radioactive half-life of 14 years and is a bitch to clean up
   after.  Repeated K9 droppings on a planet can turn the core from magma into dogma.
   The affects are similar to the old neutron bomb, but a hell of a lot cheaper to
   produce.  And those mongrels in the Galactic EPA don&#39;t hound you to follow a lot
   of safety regulations.  Theinitial test was perform on Canis Majoris and doggone it
   if it didn&#39;t work the first time.
</p>
<p>It is only the second weapon of mass destruction ever produced by the Disknee
   company, the first being the ill-fated Bambi Firestorm bomb.

<h2>&#34;<q>TRUMAN WAS RIGHT</q>&#34;, SWEARS HURT WEISER</h2>
<div class="dateline">Besida Pt., Tara Sector (NIPS)</div>
<p>In a bizarre accident last night, Admiral Nuntha &#39;<q>Bud</q>&#39; Weiser, leader of
   the 82nd Space Dogs, erotomaniac and master of tongue fu was injured when his
   extreme forward velocity was terminated against a brick wall.
</p>
<p>For years the Contessa Vanessa and &#39;<q>Bud</q>&#39; have been meeting in biweekly
   trysts for the purpose of reenacting famous and memorable moments in the history of
   Earth.
</p>
<p>Careful examination of the tape from the camera they had filming the event revealed
   the following.
</p>
<p>The tantalizing Contessa lay seductively on the bed dressed in a Wonder Woman
   outfit.  Tonight she was playing the role of the European continent and was waiting
   to be ravaged.  &#39;<q>Bud</q>&#39; stood poised at the end of the bed wearing a Batman
   costume and ready to act out the part of the Mongol horde.  He jumped up on the edge
   of the bed getting ready to pillage and plunder the lovely Balkans when his cape
   floated up and got caught in the blades of the ceiling fan.  It picked him up and
   began whirling him around the room like a lone sock in a crazed Maytag on spin cycle.
</p>
<p>Eventually his cape ripped and the unleashed force sent him hurling across the room,
   through an open window, across the yard and into wall of the house next door.
   Neighbors sitting outside awarded &#39;<q>Bud</q>&#39;, 9.6, 9.5 and 9.7 with mandatory
   points deducted for bouncing on the landing.
</p>
<p>It was then that Nuntha uttered, &#34;<q>Truman was right,</q>&#34; before lapsing into
   unconsciousness.  This is of course an obvious reference to Amalgamation physicist
   and crackpot, Triden Truman, who once theorized that if centrifugal force let go and
   gravity took over your body would suffer severe structural damage.  Unfortunately,
   Triden was crushed to death after falling down a mine shaft while testing half of
   his theory.
</p>
<p>Weiser is currently residing at the Pug Wars Veterans Hospital, and should recover
   nicely and plans are already underway for next weeks&#39; X-rated staging of
   Hannibal crossing the Alps followed by the Spanish Armada (Bud) going down at the
   Strait of Dover (Vanessa).
